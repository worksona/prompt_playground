## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open index.html in a modern web browser
3. Enter the required credentials (password and OpenAI API key)

## Development Guide

### Adding New Personas
To add new personas, modify the `personas.json` file following the existing structure:
```json
{
  "id": "unique_identifier",
  "name": "Persona Name",
  "emoji": "ðŸ”µ",
  "description": "Detailed description..."
}
```

### Extending Functionality
1. **Adding New File Types**:
   - Extend the FileProcessor class in app.js
   - Add new mime types to SUPPORTED_IMAGE_TYPES in personas.json

2. **Custom Visualization**:
   - Modify the VoronoiBackground component in app.js
   - Adjust D3.js parameters for different visual effects

3. **New Features**:
   - Add new components to the React component tree
   - Update the state management in the App component
   - Add corresponding styles in styles.css

## API Integration
The application uses the OpenAI Chat Completions API. To integrate with other APIs:
1. Modify the runPrompt function in App component
2. Update the model selection options
3. Adjust the API request format as needed

## Security Considerations
- API keys are stored in memory only
- No server-side storage of credentials
- Client-side file processing for privacy

## Build and Deployment
The application is designed to run directly in the browser without a build step. For production:
1. Minify the JavaScript and CSS files
2. Use production versions of React
3. Configure proper CORS headers if deploying to a custom domain
