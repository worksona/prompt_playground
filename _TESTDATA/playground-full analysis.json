  "sourceContent": "That I found is. You guys probably have a long conversations. And that's where stuff gets done. Totally, um, and that's where people come out and where they decide on things. And then they move out, they do research and Analysis, they come back with more stuff, but the conversation is really important and, um, you can do that with documents now and you can be conversation with them and you can actually get a lot of value out of it.\n\nWhat I like about where we're at is, we can have these very good conversations and if we take the transcript and we use them over time, They become a great resource for. Not just saying, oh look, we talked about it, but we can go to the next meeting and say, oh, we talked about it.\n\nWhere are we at? And that's a very simple one, because humans do that all the time, but The fact that you're dealing with such dense and specific subject matter. Yep. Who's probably a lot of information value that just doesn't get utilized or recognized. Yeah. And then it's down the line where you want access to it.\n\nYeah. And it's difficult because it's people, Yeah. And so, Being able to work with the conversation deal, with the documents in context of the people is what I provide, it's like being able to use personas and documents and AI to be able to understand what is actually happened. With an isolation of a meeting or a document, then do a lot of analysis of interviews.\n\nUm, But also through a project. Okay. And so what would be like an example? Yeah. So I do Product development software person. And so I do a lot of user experience research so I do a lot of one-on-one interviews, okay? In this case, I'm going to be doing a lot of talking, but I usually try to do mostly listening.\n\nUm, and in those interviews, I'm trying to understand like I am with you in a second. I understand what you're doing and what your situation is, and what the problems are that you experience in your day-to-day life, as well as with the goals that you're trying to achieve and by understanding that in a user experience role, like, I'm this expert or this person who does this thing, I can empathize with you in a much.\n\nRicher way as to what you're trying to do with the stuff I'm building. That's just a that's how it relates to software. Do you guys have these meetings? Or you have all these people involved and you probably have some understanding of them and you probably try to work with that Persona of them so that you're Building consensus across the board, not only with the content matter with the process of the personalities.\n\nAnd so when I take these interviews, I'm able to with my AI process, them with agents to produce user Journeys. Workflows. They have Bill diagrams. Um, day in the life of. So I understand what that is, the challenges that they actually have in service. The problems, pains points achievements.\n\nThese all contribute to some aggregate understanding of what happens in that role. And it's kind of reminds me of like human-centric, like design thinking. That's exactly what it is. That's 100. That's right. You just nailed it but I'm calling it user experience design, which is software related. Yeah, but you do interviews all the time and you do, um, Usually two or three or four or five way conversations and you're trying to get to some point in it and there's structure and agenda to it.\n\nAnd if you have that kind of thing in, you actually repeatedly analyze it, like you would for interviewing somebody to come into a role, right? You're kind of like apple to apples and you're like, oh, we don't even think we just find the role. Well, or we got somebody.\n\nYou know, you can figure that out over a few interviews. And so, that's what I'm able to do with. Thousand. And then not only just say, okay, I can build really good understanding who we're dealing with. In terms of the roles, I can use them in my software, I can use them to measure.\n\nWhat I'm talking about because I can say with a large language, morals, here's a representation of the person. Here's how Dave talks. Bring it to something that would be more, you know, in the using more analogies or get rid of days of the analogies and just use examples, right?\n\nAnd then you can do that. And it changes the tongue, the Timber and the actual content, but still achieves, the goals. And so, I'm able to take interviews build assets that I would use and software development. My people would use so that they like okay, yeah. Their goal is not what I'm doing and so you could actually make sure that you're achieving the bull and software like you would real world.\n\nUm but I'm doing with agents now, and I'm doing it with the ability to say that. I produce I'm a Content, producer. Content creator. Your knowledge worker. Do you do physical work with your hands? No. Okay, so we're all content created, that's all we do is we create some sort of content.\n\nWe do this really cool thing of Engagement but we all create content and we create content that gets shared and distributed and a lot of the time that content is not useful and it doesn't get distributed totally. I really thinking a lot about knowledge management systems lately. Yeah I just found a platform that's like a really well for me.\n\nI've been using notion right? That's a great one and yeah switching over to sublime. It's really new. I don't you've heard of something uh well supplement used to be a version control system so I could see it being evolved into something. That would be our content management. Yeah. But there's like, moving Beyond content and even moving beyond curation.\n\nYes, yes. So you get to strategy possibly? Yeah. Yeah. Or something like achieving objectives or defining objectives, and saying, here's my Corpus at work. Yeah, okay, cool. Yeah. So we're gonna find that middle ground. And so, that's one of the things I do in the interviews is try to understand where our interfaces My thoughts were, you know, this is just me listening to Scott because I get to see Scott after.\n\nAnd before he has these really large Sprints, delivering something right to a meeting. Usually in a meeting that sounds like for me, you know, who I am, would be like really hard. And it would be, um, You know. Politically motivated. You want to make sure you're talking to the people in the right way.\n\nSo it's kind of like a quote that always inspires me with like, CT work with Scott that I like have at the top of the document I put Um, we're drowning information while starving for wisdom, right? The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers people able to put together the right information at the right time than critically about it and make important choices wisely.\n\nA lot of it is like connecting the dots, really? Because, I'm not a subject matter expert in this, hi, but I think I'm good at that. How about we'll, we've already found Common Ground. Yeah. And your common ground in my Common. Ground is understanding patterns about the work that we can apply our patterns to, to understand and get understand a big.\n\nAnd that's why I'm working with YouTube because your background is not in the environment, but you have the understanding to do this. And so do you like, you? And so what I need to know is how do we get? How do we get to that? Because Presentation that we did last Thursday.\n\nYeah, at the end of that I was like That did not convey anything right close to what I'm sorry displaying, but it's not okay. You had an example, right? Yeah, it's hard to like, construct, an example for people in their own domain. But if you've had that one, you know, you've had to work, you know, you got the answers and it was the wrong conversation.\n\nWell, that's tough. And so one of the first things that I recognize is me, being me pitching like I'm in an entrepreneur, I have to pitch, right? So be having conversations of a certain kind that's a practice thing, man. God, you know, I would really like to be better at it.\n\nInstead of going into the game every time, like, where do I practice? Well, I do it with the LOL. All right, set up my Corpus, my pitch and I, I say these are my personas, and then I have a process where my agent will, then engage with them, or I will now with voice and I pitch my own product, and they're giving me feedback from their point of view.\n\nAnd so, usually, it's an expert point of view that they're investing in certain area of certain way. But everybody has concerns, And golden concerns because they're very ambiguous. The concern could be Okay, he won't shut up or, you know, or they're sandbagging or yeah, so you look at them critically in a different way.\n\nYeah. And so if you have those different critical lenses, they understand people. Look at you, you can get feedback ahead of time. And then you can do this thing. This thing top. Yeah, you can have strategies that aren't just like I think I'll be able to react to this well because I got enough information.\n\nAnd I was the guy that was doing that part for decades because I would have all the information, I would make sure because I wasn't a domain expert, I had to go in and learn it and I had the Frameworks to do that over top. Now and questions nothing but F in questions.\n\nAnd In this case where you're using AI you can just Point your questions out of Corpus and work, raise the information level higher and then come at it with the strategies your statement at the top is ostensibly what I'm building. Is a workflow from left to right where I can say I need to have a strategy.\n\nI don't care who the workers are. I have a corpus of work. His corpus work. Is this folder? And I need you to look at it this way and come up with some strategies based on what we've talked about on the ancillary sides of the core of our work.\n\nRight? That's what I want to do. Okay, that's what we're going. Because I I make sense of note taker. Yeah, extensive. So, the systems, I build are expert in terms of being able to do this, kind of But you define a problem. If there's somewhere between what you want to have, as the objective view, and the Strategic view, and what you experience in terms of that last meeting, Yeah, why this is six years of work in 20 minutes plus try to get the emotional content of what happened and at the end 60 people were like any questions.\n\nI might have a question. This thing is going to affect them all in a big way and they don't even know what question I ask. So, so it's not okay. So I can have I have a corollary to that, I presented to some of your peers and uh, they didn't know what questions to ask me.\n\nI. Yeah, so I built a questionnaire where you could start with a simple question. It would get so rigorous on your questions because we did down in frameworks and then it would basically give you oh those. That's how it all works. You know, the questions. Yeah. Right. To find what you did.\n\nWe Build personas and they could offer you. That town hall experience, where everyone's shutting up. Cuz if you're going back and talking, aren't they? But they're interpretation of what? Yeah, that's what I went out for drinks afterwards with them. Okay. And people were like, yeah. So one of them was like, oh, this is really cool and this I know she does not a connect box but She was like, so yeah, that was really cool, he presented today.\n\nAnd, you know, we already have this over here and here because we we brought in this little bit of knowledge and we put it into our system. And I said, this is a new government to government of the body that's going to be led. By silk laws, that are totally different from our lives.\n\nIt's going to have a more profound effect and she's like, oh, is it? Oh my God. They don't understand some of the primary stuff. Well, I'm not very many people do. Yeah. Because It was all closed. Doors, there's only 60 people that were involved. And I like what Anna said um about your presentation.\n\nI don't know if you remember, but she said, you know, Um, this isn't co-management happening right now. This is the co-creation of co-management happening right now. That's a great way of phrasing and like, and I think what she meant by, that was like, we're going to do territory here like because people have all these questions of like what it's going to look like.\n\nAnd I think it's okay to say we don't know what it's going to look like because it's never been done before so we could everyone like yes to work together to get on the same page at least for what we do know. And then like I don't know, show each other the grace to like Like, I don't know, questions and comments like that.\n\nIt's like, oh yeah. Everything's not paying attention. Yeah, like a nutmeg thing. Yeah. And you know, I didn't I didn't say that, you know, people should have been like having five questions to ask because They're not, that's not their world. They don't operate. They don't think a co-creating. Not very many people are operating in that space.\n\nYeah. And to understand what it really means. But yeah. Yeah. Do you think it's important to um get people inspired to take like a step back and like look at the biggest picture and look at the root of things. Is that part of the word? Yes. Okay. Yeah. So when Dave said, you know, what are we doing today?\n\nI basically said, you know, there's two parts of this. We just need to map out all the activities going on. It's the simple activity connectedness project. But I also think about, you know, we have this new government to government body. Now, saying they're going to look after. Water. But Water for the First Nations is everything.\n\nEverything holds in the water so that's land. Biodiversity habitat. So all this all their projects. Almost all. Could eventually I was talking to Tessa. Fall underneath this leadership too. Rather than ocp having a bunch of, you know, staff people, interesting. So eventually we get direction on some of the major issues from that leader, tie it into water, like certainly our new Wetland mapping that we've done is blows.\n\nAnything that anyone in Canada has really, occp is producing it, it blows my mind that our little organization, everyone, the feds. And the province are just like disappointed. We're working towards this and we should have it in five years and like, well, here it is now. Yeah, you got everything.\n\nNot even beyond the framework as functional. Oh yeah. How come, how come we're out of the game on that? Because we think about it often. And we're, we have responsibility, we take responsibility and we have to produce If we don't produce we we don't get funding whereas other organizations right?\n\nOr just like well that's an interesting idea. We should keep thinking about this.\n\nIt's interesting. What you said though about like like the okay RPI project and that kind of being Almost like the Umbrella. Play more for like all the other like you're seeing all the other work can feed into that. Yeah. So I did my almost hesitant to show this. No.\n\nNo, those are great. Yeah. So this this is great because this is you who an outsider looking in almost. And and so that makes it's really helpful for me to see what where your thought patterns are going. Well I I when I thought about it, the conservation planning tool, it's like a part of every project, right?\n\nNo. Like we need that for almost almost. What is it? Not Here, it's like Improving the data for the Tor. Now, for creating the terms of references, it would be here. We're using the tool for like standardizing the data. Yeah, for the CPC same thing, like it's just providing the spatial data.\n\nUm you can see I've never thought is that I would never have written a tool at the top, but the way you've written it is correct. And it can be interesting. Things is when how it's structured and two how you experience it. Yeah okay so And they can both be there because how things work isn't how you use it.\n\nYeah, so that's what you're pointing to you. Both see this differently in the right? It's incredibly um important that you have both views or more as many But like it beyond at the top as yeah Davis saying doesn't mean anything it's more just like. Hey, this is one thing that I thought was kind of connected to everything we're doing but so is the biodiversity strategy?\n\nBecause it's not the whole point. It's not like the outcome of all the work is. Yeah. Like or an outcome of like doing conservation, work is having biodiversity so I don't know. That's another Thing that I wrote down. Yeah, that's really valuable because you're creating the entities and you're showing the relationships.\n\nI mean I wrote all all five projects so everything except the biodiversity strategy? Yeah feed directly into the strategies implementation. So that's the Tor, the planning tool and cpcc. So it's workflow or it aligns with its goals, which is the connectivity. In Oakhill RPI. Yeah. Anyway, that's what I have.\n\nAnd so, I think now we We can understand this. If we could work on this today and we could all get a really good understanding and learn some things about the How they're connected and probably expand on them of it. But to link this to, that new governing body.\n\nYeah, I mean, that's it's the critical part. Yeah. So you have these two Systems almost. And there's a values that an interface of values, you can call it policy. Um, more values are put into Yeah, law. Yeah yeah. Yeah. So um and that's an interesting thing because you can do that with humans.\n\nDo that all the time. We talked about synthesis I think. Um, and that's what we do. We do synthesis at the level of policy and humans do that and that's what politick is all about. There's like we have this policy and we use it in our heads to apply it to this problem.\n\nLike you didn't apply it very well. Yeah. Oh we didn't use it at all. Um, so whatever that interface is. I would usually start at that as seeing what it's determining. The nature is You know what you do? Do you know the other thing very well? Yeah. Well since I've been there since the beginning.\n\nYeah. I kind of have my finger on it. Yeah. Yeah, I feel like a big purpose of today's also just getting Scott. Yeah. Like I I've got a sense of things. We've talked about things, but it's also Big gaps. And you do all this work and I sometimes I just get the news.\n\nI'm like oh my God he is probably so stressed or was so stressed. Yeah, not this week what? I mean it's just a natural thing. Leading up to one of these meetings and it hitting the news so widely. Yeah, you know, quiet way it's super quiet. But here, you know, I here's a good example.\n\nI've been touching the weeds. I'm trying to get this thing signed, and in the background, dealing with racist, and the lawyers and say arguments, and, and then finally it presented, I'm saying, yeah, we finally signed a symbol you Thanks God, and the team for, you know, TSF for creating a new government to government body.\n\nAnd I've been just saying, yeah, we signed an amo Or an MOA in my mind. I'm like, okay because I know it's the government body but I don't say it. I'm doing work in an industry where people identify the reports as the problem in their life. Yeah. Like it's not the fact that the reports do something It's the report.\n\nYeah. Right. So you identify with the output. And you will forgive a stupid process to get to the output. But it is a Again, it changes how things are, you've got this policy which isn't how people actually function. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, start drawing. I think what would be a little bit helpful for me is if we could just take a couple of minutes, you just clearly Define what the purpose for today's like brainstorming session.\n\nYeah, for me. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so That means is also working on to sort of a report, not an update report or what we've been doing since. Probably about three three and a half years of work. So five years five. Is it five years? The last one was five years ago.\n\nIt's really bad right now. I've got seven. No, what years? 60. What Yeah, I I can bug him on the game. And the way that my mind works is yeah, so like in the I'm updating on all the different projects that owes to see who's done in the last five years.\n\nBut I'm trying, this is how we came to this conversation. As I'm trying to connect trying to figure out the best way to present this information and keeping the audience in mind, including the funders. Like, you know, I think there could be really powerful way to like, yeah, kill two birds in one stone is like, showing all the key stakeholders like this is all the important critical work that we're doing and getting that re-engagement.\n\nBut then also like, showing the funders like this is All the cool things that you're doing with your money and like, this, how we've been adding value. Yeah. How I go about that. From my point of view to add to this is, I would say you've got a corpus of work and from that purposely work, you want to provide different views to different people.\n\nYou can even say here's the report, I want to make sure investors. See this I want to then, okay, let's make sure it's PR. Do that or whoever your internal people are. My whole thing is to set up Personas of them and say well I'm delivering to this person, their expectations of this And then use the AI to conform the answers to it.\n\nWell, how important do you think that is Scott like keeping the audience in mind for the support? Yeah, so for the report and for the website too. Yeah so the report we can keep it lower level. Yeah. But when we do reporting out here's the report. But when we send it out to group over there group, a, we can use that to figure out what the question is.\n\nLike we could create okay ahead of time. Yeah. And a politician. It's like what would what would that be wondering? Yeah, you could okay, low level questions where it's good at. It is either there's three, things, one, research analysis did undercover that or performing your answers right to say, like present me the report.\n\nIn this way, I can do all kinds of stuff in between to then say let's build documents that are just add to do that. But really, it's saying I have these inputs. What you would normally do is like, read and analyze themselves and then say, okay I've got a framework over attack.\n\nNow, I know what documents I can put stuff into now, let's figure out. How do I summarize it? And then what's the framework for presentation? And some of those things don't matter to most people. And so, You can do all that. And then at the end, you're like, okay, Yeah, last time we did this, everybody At the end, which means I didn't understand my audience.\n\nSo what's the message or didn't care about my life? Didn't care about my audience? Yeah, I signed the mou and that was all I need are, am I? Yeah. So, if you do it ahead of time. Conforming to your audience is one of here. I have to report to the government.\n\nThis way, it's a document. It's a report. Yeah, or hey I've got the governments of Grant application. Here's my information, put it in that format for me. Does that really well? Or you analyze things from the point of view of, I have all these actors, they need all this information.\n\nWhat should I be growing? Where with anything Like, so, I think back to report though, I think You know, normally you would say who's your audience, your target a document type, aim for one area, but It's such a chopped up report, we could aim who who really needs to know.\n\nI'm kind of activity about connectivity, and just redesign it to focus on. Yes, and talk about the government that design. Politicians in general public people. Yeah. Yeah. And so so do you just change if you have those understandings? What those messages are? Yeah. Then you can work with anybody of information.\n\nBut we normally do is take our body of information and work towards that. In the case of what I have you have personas and you say well it would be concerned for this kind of thing. Some of it's not, right? Yeah. In some of it, you know, you have already so you have that to the mix but what you do for sure is you provide yourself with at least a better understanding because you can you can build facts around it, like you can present information.\n\nAnd here's uh, one minute, here's five minutes, there's general audience, here's expert level. That's what I'm building. An engine just for that. Brain document. Yeah. And then pick up Persona so talking about wanting to do this in the very tight way. Everybody is wanting to communicate Nicely. You provide them a huge PDF point, and you guys do that.\n\nYeah, you guys like, unfortunately, you guys are researchers like me and you're not good at concise marketing information. So generalization, yeah. But yeah, true. So what's the alternative to providing? Like a long PDF report? A concise report that's targeted like you're saying the government needs this information, So what do they ask you?\n\nI don't know. From the government's point of view, we report this way. They are concerned about these things and yeah, they are. But the people are concerned about these things, bring them together and then you know what kind of report you need. I can, I can build a report that it just makes sure that I am confident, but no one will rate it.\n\nThe executive summary is what people want. They want something that sounds like what they've heard, you're the same format. And so knowing that you're dealing with, you know the government and you have a certain tone and you're reporting and you have to have citations. Well that's a great way of dealing nobody in the public gives that shit about your citations.\n\nYeah no but another objective that's report. We should be thinking about, why? We're not just producing this report because we need to provide an update. We have a goal to transition. All our work to this government, okay? But my gift to you will be this piece of paper and I explain it to you.\n\nYeah. And it is what I uncover before. I was, you know, well programming, what I'm doing right now. It is what you need in place when you don't have a process to the answer. Be like, well, we need to get to an answer. I don't know how to do that people, that would be showstopper for everybody and it'll be a huge social software for money.\n\nAnd so what I do is I cast it into a functional strategy. I say Need to understand what the process is to be able to leverage this and make sure it goes to Market. Steps back and says, I don't know what the process is, I need to understand it and that's a long-term thing.\n\nThat strategy never ends. And then I put criteria underneath to see if I'm actually measuring against that you guys do this. All right, but if you put this in the place where A person has a strategy, the government has a strategy to engage with you. They're measuring that strategy against whatever they get back from you.\n\nThat's their criteria. You can put that against anything. Yeah, and it's just a strategy. The strategy is, you need to do this, your documents need to have Clarity. You need to be able to cite them. You need to help the track on all of the hours. Put against that's their strategy.\n\nYeah. And their success for their strategies they have the documentation to prove that you've done it. Yeah, I can tell you right now. The feds and the province, like four connectivity. Are asking us how we measure. How do we measure if you're doing sis? Can you write us all the stuff you're going to do?\n\nAnd how why it's good? And so we give it to them like this is how you have to measure and then that's what you always want to do. I want, I give all of my clients. Here's how you can measure the success of my work. Here's how you measure the effectiveness.\n\nAnd that's not delivering on anyone thing. It's the clarity of the information and if they're not sure what that means. I give them an example. Yeah, yeah. And you guys have examples you delivered on reports so you can do this in an ambiguously sounding way and get directly to it and this is what you have to do and you're doing it all the time.\n\nYou're saying, My strategy is I'm going to listen, Dave, because Scott's brought him here. And that's what my strategy is right now. You know, and it's eventually there will be something that makes sense and that's what my strategy like you're sitting there in this. The criteria is I don't know what your criteria is, um, but there's a way of looking at this in your space.\n\nEven use this as the interface we pull. What you're talking about? Do you have a strategy with we think? They don't want to know this, then you can ask them. Is this what you want to know? And then you say if we can say, if you want to know this, then you don't need all this information.\n\nYou just need this piece of paper. If you want anything more, we have it. But what, what you're going to need to do moving forward is conform. Your answer to about a minutes worth of conversation. And I'm not doing that right now. Yeah.\n\nWhat would be helped like you're saying? That's what I would say. Strategy would be the goal. Is what Yeah. To have some framework in which you can actually interface two different bodies. That yeah, let's confirm. Our understanding about the connectivity of all the project scores. That's a simple task.\n\nWe can do that. So that's an objective. Yeah. That's the app for sure. Yeah.\n\nHow about, how about, how about, how about here is? Oh, that's just the first one. I would like to be able to be in some position. Like, okay, what's this, what's, what is the context for this overall thing? What is the one thing that's just all doing? What is the one thing that this is all done?\n\nIn my mind, it's to protect. All the way things. Right, so that's that's a one-zero thing so you found it. Okay, good, you're good. We have to step back from that because that's beyond moral, right? And it's actually the most moral question, So what makes it political? What makes it social?\n\nWhat makes it a socio-technical problem? Actually, get a little freezing of things socio-technical, studying the systems in which that I, I think it's best. Yeah. So how does that play out in the next level for this opportunity? What is the highest objective? You can have here? Of this project of this time.\n\nYeah. I think we, We have the political power, and the political support. To basically Implement all those Collective work that everyone's working on to protect the environment. Because right now, we're working at A sub. So right now we have all the people all the partners. But well, I'm at this staff level and every time we go to approve something, if I really want to change policy it's like a year and a half.\n\nProcess. I work with one of them to change the policies but one of them But now we have this big governing body, that covers the entire region entire Watersheds. And if if I can introduce the project at the beginning saying this is these are the five things we're going to be doing.\n\nWe're gonna have that kind of dippy and they approve it at the beginning. Then I have policy. Oh I have a legal body that can actually allow me to change all that. What were the entire region? Yeah. Okay. You said it. That's, that was perfect. That's what we can hang you.\n\nYou can without me, you can hang everything off that statement. Okay, I'll make sure you get it. But that's everything right there. Yeah. And you've set a goals objectives and you've lined up what you want to do, you want to introduce five themes that have regulatory teeth that aren't deterministic about their process nor their plans or what they actually effectively do.\n\nThese are themes that are On their way. Sustaining life. And you want some tacit approval for these themes to be core. Focuses for everybody to align their work alarm. Yeah, something along it. Yeah, yeah. So Part of that MOA is we already have? 20 principles. 10 from First Nations.\n\nAnd they kind of line up with all this works that MOA lines up.\n\nProtect everything. That's great. And then we can But there's a ton of what to do with that group as well. Yeah, but yeah, I think you said it more than I could. Understand prior to this. So okay. But how do you see that? I'm I'm the super Outsider so I get to see the patterns in place that that, you know, I can't apply.\n\nYeah. But what you said was you want to get out the front of the mouth or yeah, yeah, right. And you're dealing with the shit out of the animals might bad analogies a way of scrubbing out. Um, but really, I try to get to the mouthy animal too. Like you feed it here rather than, well, it's digesting through the system, you're like, well, now we gotta go back off.\n\nYeah. Like that's not how I use the body politic as an analogy. You can't go back up. Yeah. But Um, it's If you can step back from the actual machinations and say, Spoon of knowledge. You like this is what's happening and you have to go not even It's like Russian dolls, deep.\n\nYeah, to change things. Every time I want to change the following stuff like that's crazy and it doesn't affect the neighbor. So, Russian dolls, um, is interesting, because it could be a recursive thing, right? And so you're going down to find the people to find some kernel of what you can attach to that and say, oh, through the paperwork, I can send us.\n\nYeah. To the point where it becomes an opportunity for discussion around policy. Yeah. I mean you get closer to the mouth. Yeah. That's the most articulate conversation. We've had about the problem that I've understood your job to be. Is that you have to be in the weeds. Yeah. And guess what?\n\nI can appreciate that because I'm coding and that's that's as deep as it gets. Yeah. And most of the time I'm talking about Way bigger things in terms of their accessible to everybody, but You have what I call the layers, the layered cake opportunity and if you structure your information in a keying way then it will work for you and that's what you've started doing and I think you're in a great position to do that and you're too embroiled in it.\n\nUm, What you need is like what I need and that is some Cadence for you to be told internally or by somebody else to say, snap out of it, take a step back. Go for a walk, put on a different hat. Recognize, you don't need to do that shit or you know what I mean?\n\nYeah. Yeah. Um, It's not time for that because You know what? I'm stuck in it. I need to be an entrepreneur and I'm building a product. Like, I'm 25. Yeah. Kind of cool about whatever. It's like building reports. It's not that cool after a while. Yeah. As I say, we're all content, producers.\n\nThis is like I just realizes today I'm like, yeah I know I've always been, I do lots of notes, I would have content all the time. Then like, And they started realizing I did 5. 000 lines of code over the weekend, right? It's hard to write 5000 lines of anything.\n\nYeah, so okay that's that's proof that I should continue in your space. You got way too much stuff. Yeah that's how you feel sometimes. But I'm going to write something though, because I haven't really thought about running in this place.\n\nSo here. This is our Statement. Uh, cooperation.\n\nSo this was the founding thing for CCT, where we got all the bodies. Thanks, we've got 40 people.\n\nYeah, kind of Kind of lays out. Talked a little bit about. Maybe we should be working with the indigenous people but the language 15 years ago was you know it's in there but It's it's not it wasn't it wasn't found in or grounded. Yeah it was it wasn't good enough but it was for the time it was way ahead at this time.\n\nYeah, yeah. And from there time is. You're 40. So we worked with a bigger group. The organization.\n\nThis is exactly what Evan has been busy consistency. So many organizations. Yeah. And this is where all projects. Still come from even though this is 10 years old. Yeah.\n\nBut it's almost running out because we're almost done the major ones. So we need eventually, we'll need a new bottom strategy. Maybe. So, it gets funny. Yeah, just because If you want to, Operate under a strategy. This is now All right, so it's strategy. It's criteria. Has been met.\n\n100 objectives that happens. Oh my God. That you call that your criteria. Yeah, it's just like probably even gone projects. Yeah, a bit. How do you need an objective? You do a project. And so what what this group here, way about 10 years ago? They had a lot to deal with dealt with the province and feds and when they would try to implement it, there was no way.\n\nUs to hold the hammer. Or anything with the problems events. But now we're now we're starting to have I think that governing body. What's a hammer mean? Well, basically, uh, like, when we work with local governments,\n\nInfluence or Yeah, we have no way to influence. But we can hunt, but we have no way to finalize it. It can't work to the very end because we're not in Victoria or not. Oh you're you're you don't have authority, you have no authority, right? All the responsibility. With them all the time.\n\nYeah, I figured it out a while ago, that's the phrase. So the main main body to work Keeping the landscape landscape. From being fragmented. Because he fragment, No, it's easier to kill it. Yeah, yeah, nothing can survive. That's how the city is good. And have it up.\n\nWe have several of those projects. The other one is about, even though it's similar is Water. How are we protecting?\n\nI'm not sure about call. I'm pretty sure I could jam everything underneath these two things, but I think I might need another box. Oh yeah, because all the technical stuff probably could come underneath, but let me just leave that.\n\nSo, when it comes to Got these 80.\n\nBecause, Even though we have, we're just going back, we're now taking over the south Okanagan. Well. And in the meantime, we expanded Conservation program. And so, so that's part of the statement of operation. Yeah, this is kind of just disposis as a side objective. What does that say? Talk indigenous.\n\nOkay.\n\nI'm just trying to rock. What would this took probably a year? So when I used to work Glenn, manzig more, Glenn Serious, I used to work. I remember, yeah. A guy in him and he he ran through Thompson Nicholas. So the idea was for eventually OCCP. To take on to Thompson Nikola and the South Oklahoma and then we'd have one organization.\n\nHilary. But there's so much work. I don't want to do that. Right? There's that's the way there's regionality. Yeah. And then Danielle wanted to come work for me and I just said, you know, I think you have enough skill set to start your own thing. So she's been doing that.\n\nShe's on therapy in the year three here. They're doing good. They're doing all this step of work over there. So, I think this other one is, is about How do we do polic? Even though it's underneath this stuff, It's like, is it? So, one of the things that I get is like, Certain kinds of effect by having things at the top of an organization or organization chart moves down, and it is policy applied.\n\nHeavily like a strategy or is it replied across the border where people do their work? Yet. So, when we do policy, It's mainly key people out here. There's help. To write their policy and get it, get it adopted. But we haven't really changed any provincial policy. Yet, it's all been local government policies.\n\nLike Regional district levels. Yeah. And and city level seven. Yeah. And and the only way we can do that is because in BC The local government act. Allows you to protect the environment, only in DC. All the rest of the provinces don't have that in the local government. Sorry, it allows you to attach that government allows you to do that.\n\nYeah. So to make laws to do that. Yeah. Protect which government the local government. So local governments can actually go way beyond what the problem is doing just saying we're going to be right. This up our own laws by laws that protect the environment, right? So Regional laws are more specific and Powerful.\n\nSo like The U.S and their states. And yeah. Some states have fun. Yeah. And even even more powerful in their state and even when I talk to like provincial people, they're like well how are you going to enact? This is the local government and they have no idea. Yeah, so, you know, there's yeah.\n\nYeah, it's a big question that you got. Yeah, how do you enact anything? Yeah, I think specifically on Thursday, someone said local governments are asleep to sleep in federal government. So, how are you gonna do? What's the question? That would be a little more understanding. Yeah. And so we, we brought in lawyers to talk to them audio group.\n\nYeah. Who understand the unexercised jurisdiction? They call it an exercise. Yeah. So that's all you guys can do much. And some of the mirrors, talk to them five hours and laid out how that can do it. Some of them are still like Are like, oh, Yeah, and then plus, with the nation being involved, Makes it more powerful.\n\nSo For us to get to better policy. Declaration, the rights vintages people back. And it's the only app in the world. To actually Implement ungroup. So we are British Columbia is the world leader in this right now and there are some other teams like ours doing this and stuff.\n\nThis is a world leader in this. Yeah it's the only one that has legislature like a regional follow-ups. Provincial Polo or prevention. Sorry. Yeah accent. Yeah, yeah. And then, About 2018, they put in a new water sustainability on it. And they said, hey. If anyone can ever work with the First Nations and work together, And design something, how to protect your Watershed.\n\nYou can now use this app. No one's used it yet. And it allows you once you have indigenous. Engagement. And your neighbors. You can now create a water sustainability.\n\nThat allows you to take away annual allowable cuts. Great Community. Watersheds designate new protected areas and are underneath. This is like the yeah. The enablers that you have access to that. You're working towards working towards. Yeah. So without these we would be like back down at the local government level, right?\n\nSo you do things like you'd have to do that uh Russian dolls. Yeah. To get a park done to get. Oh yeah Greenway done. Yeah. And so, for last five years, we've been meeting with about 15, 27 organizations, Just I think we'll have, like, seven or eleven pull-day. Workshops talk about, what are the big things we need to solve water issue?\n\nSo we A word document. What this deck at? What time? What you should do? And so, We're going to call that a water responsibility plan. Oh, cool! That's approachable. Yeah. And that's both here. Everybody's stuff. And it's so cold. Oh yeah. And so the cheese, so we've been working with all the cheese and all the Nations and they're leading this amalgamation of working with their neighbors.\n\nTo protect water. But really, our goal is to get a lot of responsibility plan. Uh, leadership table. To an act. Yes, to start protecting the watership. And getting control over. And in my mind. Blend back. Yeah. Okay, so yeah. Maybe what you're saying over here without things? Maybe land back is what you are.\n\nOkay, it's hard to start. No, no it doesn't. Go overwhelmed but the rest of the ground How about that's the thing that you don't say? Yeah, that's the thing you don't say. Man back to land. Yeah, that's what it is. Yeah, somewhere. It's like, okay, you can actually survive, you can survive.\n\nSo right now we have, we have a contract out. Well, no, we're we're creating an advisory team. To oversee. To take that a big pile of documents that we're working for five years of what we think. So, we have silk A writer. And then we have a lawyers from the informed to walk Foundation.\n\nVictoria. That are going to be like the advisory team to help us write this thing because these guys know All that stuff works. How this stuff works? Yeah. But they say You also need to change the mining. And the forestry. Oh my gosh. And so they of course yes resource basis.\n\nThey say I'm like in my mind that's like that. How do we do that? Make case. I don't worry, we do it all the time. So, So I'm like, okay good. That sounds impossible. Yeah, that sounds impossible. Yeah. Those are some of the goals that's the resource based in the province is huge.\n\nSo yeah. Um, I think you sort of see that the love of elevation going from a biodiversity strategy at local level. To do in this type of work, through a lot of responsibility plan that covers the entire leadership. Right? So you're you're looking for those higher level. You know, values and play.\n\nYeah, it's like Watershed. Yeah, instead of What? You know this specific. Yeah. Yeah. Is specific area in this region? You're like, okay, Cologne is really friendly. Let's find lots of projects in Gleno. Yeah, right. I'm just like, no, no, it's too much work. Yeah, one done. Yeah, yeah. And so you're you're constantly in the Battle of doing nothing but pilot projects.\n\nYeah, in a way. Yeah. Yeah. Give your custom in one. Yeah, yeah. They're custom. I use b smoke software. So it's the same thing. Yeah, it's always always new. And so, After. After working with us for 14 years, we still have all that original Partners. But they're also. It's not just OCCP.\n\nNow they have Because I used to be parts of CPOCP and now they're integrated through all the planning departments and in Province. And so all our old employees now work for these people and are doing their own projects, they're like, hey Scott, we're going to be doing this. I'm like, Fantastic.\n\nLike I have nothing to do with the ACP, isn't it? But It's, they're implementing. All right. So when they're out and there's an understanding of these Uh these objectives that are funded or have this track way to get them, they get used. Yeah and the funding the funding is I think it's just an easy part of it.\n\nLike if you have good projects of fun things there. Oh yeah, yeah. That's good. But it would be nice. Like we are with this uh, Leadership table. Even though this is a non-binding legal document, that this sign, there will be some recently, it's coming. And we think, Well, I'd like to hear because For the water that's open WBB.\n\nWhich is a they get money from the tax base. To do water stewardship. Uh, and have been doing it 50 years. So Several monthly dollars a year. But we have seven of their directors on the leadership table. And Anna's retiring. And so, I think that reimagining, Of what they might become and whether they blend into this or not.\n\nThis is so this is a beautiful like organizational. Experience. I'm saying that really, yeah, because it's so Layton was concerns. Yeah. It was like, You know, technically how they work together and Socially, how people are like so important to doing? This is all willpower. Yeah, it is and it's all people if you get the right people.\n\nYeah, yeah it works. Well, that's my willpower. Yeah. Willingness to do it. Yeah. Yeah, and I would say, Yeah, so far. Like do I see anyone where the willpower? So there is Wwbu's. Bit around fear. Like a little bit of fear of like, oh, are you guys just going to take us over?\n\nAnd we're like, no we're not. It's going to take you over because we can't\n\nI have my fingers crossed, they might hire for their new executive director with their hiring, right? And if they do hire that person, Absolute. They're just like this rest. This needs to be indigenous support because it's just it's white guy or white guys only Everything's white guys. Only, yeah, I know.\n\nBelievy. Oh my God. And I'm not away enough guy. Yeah, I'm not waiting up. I'm not all enough. No. I'm not part of the clubs that I'm supposed to be part of, I've been to their meetings, and they almost shut up. And I start talking. No, it's the outside of me.\n\nUm it's yeah it's different values in play and so then your stuff, you know, it kind of ties in right about here, right? With his all those green space, I like you have white space. It's the first thing I seek in any diagram. Um, But so this is like organization.\n\nSo there's like Enablers that are like there's so much Motion in here. Yeah right. Like that's a really neat thing. Is that without Without things flowing back and forth. This is a super complicated structure, but if you see things move, then people see the value in it, right? Like, Because everything.\n\nSo, strictly documented in this environment? Even if you look at them and you're like, this is bullshit documentation. It's strictly documented. Yeah. I'm speaking from my experience. Like you just that's a whole lot of stuff. Yeah. And I think most of the funders realize, Like the co-creating, co-governance. It is, is avoid.\n\nAll right, they're just like, oh, If you're leaving. Tell us what you did. Tell us what, where did you, what did, what did you learn from your journey? And now, they even say you don't have to write anything. You can just phone Us and tell us. So, But that's not good for us.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Well he wants back. Yeah. So you've brought up something you're very Very good. It's like, okay. So you have an understanding wallets I look at like it was a song called Bloom's tax on me. It's a taxonomy for learning. I come in at things that that leveling.\n\nOkay, go. And now how do people learn because that's what I'm using. So you understand things and you're applying them, you can apply them recognize at the very Regional level to. Now, you're working way up to the policy level. Um, What is it that you think? This has to learn.\n\nTo to no this is a rat's Nest and it's certainly something you can you can get really efficient at increasing that you know political social and Technical levels. What is this? Evolve into sort of a set. Questions. Like, I think we need to learn this to overcome this, or we need to, what is it?\n\nThat is I'm in Alberta trying to understand quality control, some example. And technically speaking the solutions are there to be had So there's something else at play. Yeah. So you're asking me your awarded questions. We do that. Ask myself. So you bring it to yourself. Yeah. What do you need to learn Scott to do this?\n\nYeah. What do you two need to learn? Your understanding to do not, not maybe, not that solution but to get to those objectives. That are higher level. What do you want to learn? I think, yeah. And it can be like if you put it in the phrasing of a strategy it can be.\n\nI want to learn about something. Yeah, not the specifics of how to get this money. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Like it can be anything but I'm really wanting to know what you two want to learn. Instead of just get something done. Yeah, there's a couple of years old. A real easy things, like, even back.\n\nWe get here. Like I'm starting to understand how we Once we use this app, To start doing things. I don't understand. We're going to reduce it annual law. We'll cut by 13. You just do it like that. They're these lawyers saying you just do it, didn't they? The rest of licenses have to follow?\n\nI'm like really like it's kind of we're missing something there. So I I need to like you can't just be that simple, right? We can't just Maria, make a different allocation. Okay, so from you'll learn about me. Yeah, you want to learn the magic on how to do that?\n\nMeaning, it sounds like magic. Yes. So You want to learn how that reality goes into play? Yeah. How you can get 13? Less cut. Yeah. But you know that's just that's one little simple thing that's been in the back of my mind. Because so what do you think you need to do to get there?\n\nWell, I think when we start talking about this water responsibility plan, Uh, it's going to be based on. I forgot that Uh, it's going to be based on silk laws. As well as Western. And so, Meatballs are much higher level of environmental Protection. And, If we do this, We're going to impact what's happening up in the Watershed.\n\nIn a much more. Bigger way. Then then people are thinking, I think people are thinking, oh, great, they got the leadership table down. Now, it's just going to be easier for us to have a conversation with the First Nation and do the consultation and check box. Like some of them are thinking that.\n\nWell, there's going to make it easier for so I can just keep doing what I'm doing. The Chiefs are saying. We're gonna we're gonna go back to being Stuarts of the land. And having a lot of big different changes on the last even though Forestry's almost done here. So I'm not too worried about Forestry and even the four mystery fourth is saying, well look kind of wrapping out there.\n\nBut Mining is coming in. Like there's 17 Minds that want to be approved here. And that affects our water in big way. So those are the things I think about is that what I really need that? A question. Those are just my next steps kind of thing. Yeah, they are.\n\nBut what I can I can react to it say like Um, You. Want to know. What? Governance means from higher level values, driving it from that point of view. If that's what you see happening. Yeah, you may want to learn what that means before it happens. Yeah, there's only like one example, that's the West Coast.\n\nGreen bear. Yeah, so they they have a new piece of legislation in there. Yeah, where is? Uh, just kind of oh on the mainland. But they have a new plan, and 250 year plan. So, all right, there's actually a long drive to it. Yeah. But that's, that's so that's getting to something that's, you know, Stands above the network of problem here.\n\nYeah. And that's kind of where it's interesting to come at it. Yeah. Um, you gave a very specific example. Yeah. And I think that's even, that's a really valuable too. The great thing is this transcript is going to be like nothing but to-do list. But it'll be organized now, right?\n\nBecause there's been points. I know I've been lost in the conversation but I'm trying you're getting to you have two now. So He started with life, it's sort of the highest objective that you guys can all contribute to stewardship. And now you're like, what does it mean to have this new Yet old sense of stewardship.\n\nYeah, as not just a An approval process. Yeah. But but to be the experience, not like those values are going to be experienced. Yeah, they're not. They're not a process. Yeah. Like to get approval. Yeah.\n\nBecause you, you know, It's just my understanding of, The nation's. View on it. They would come at it from how it impacts them culturally And it wouldn't be about the specifics of. You know who owns what? Strata of the earth. No, right. It would be like, the Earth is it needs to live?\n\nYeah. And this is how you would make sure that it lifts instead of well, here's how that actually functions. And so we just need to manage it this way. Yeah. So that's a very different understanding of governance. Yeah. It's kind of how we teach each other, how we're supposed to teach each other.\n\nYeah. But It's not how government works. Yeah sure. I might have shared this with you. Over my best. Simple explanations. Silk law right away, it's like It's right at the top of other governance structure. Whereas ours, we have like the ground, the province everybody. And then we do an impact assessment and then we go on it at a political level whether or not we want to accept.\n\nAnd so, that's where we get lost. Okay, so, How about uh, it's not recognized as a resource. That's needing to be managed because it's too plentiful. Again, I'll point to oil and gas. They don't need to solve problems because a thousand X on your on your dollar. Is it allows for all kinds of mushiness?\n\nYeah. Like no, we're not going to fix anything. It's just too profitable. Um, and so that would be a way of looking at this. I I that thing is neat. So resources at the top compared to Getting to the understanding of what resources, they're valuable. That's a really big inversion.\n\nYeah. And that's a, you know, but that, again, I'll point to the experience reasons. Resources at the top, are the experience. Yeah. Right. Go outside. It's just so, It's hard to understand that, unless Yeah, and a big part that's going to be five-year. Journey has been Educating the staff level with, with all indigenous.\n\nViews and values and laws. And people laugh because it's it's logical. Yeah, it makes it really if you think about it. It's logic. Well, they would say there's a natural logic to it. There's a not like people will rely on Common law versus natural law as a concept, right?\n\nAnd you're putting that territory, that's slippery. But it is what we are. Like if you put into your experience if you recognize nature and you would not burn it all down, yeah? Right. That's putting values. That first. So this is, this has been great. There's like what I would call layers of structure here, and you've in some ways said, okay, this is what This is an example of some of the workflow.\n\nPushing it up towards policy with them. Pull it down and enable, much more like you say, you've trained people. They've now done their thing if they know the policy or the opportunity, you're always there. Yeah. We wanted some objectives. Like what? Take away from what you so far? I got a few hammers that I don't use the hammer.\n\nI'm gonna skip by place. Hammers to make sure there's something very tangible. But it's way better for your point of view. Like this has been a morassa information and you already understood all this. At some level. So, You need to take something from this in the next, you know, hour to be able to move forward.\n\nUm, The last thing that I'm going to get part of is a plan to build a plan. Yeah. I'm already a part of a lot of those. Yeah. And what I can do is put a plan into motion so that it's actually doing something. So it's not just a plan.\n\nUm, but it really requires looking at the information in different way. And having some, Near term needs. For clarity on something. I'm good with Clarity, concision and confidence. I can provide you, those three things, if you'll engage with me. Yeah, so if we're talking about information, so there's a ton of data With the salt up like interviewed Galore ideas laws and they're actually writing down their water laws right now.\n\nAnd and even the Salt water declaration, he's kind of law as well. So, Tons of But it may be an opportunity, like what we do? We pick one person with he talked about This specific part about their thing. It won't goes, oh, that's really interesting and they learn half of that or third of that.\n\nAnd then you know a few months later we give him another little box to learn. So It's a never-ending that will take forever. Right. Pulling out some knowledge object and sharing it or knowledgeable. Please like this is this is a really important thing. I'm like I'm like like Oh my God.\n\nOne thing, the older an elder at the meeting. Basically said, you know, I take my kids up and wiggle way up. You'll pass, Rebel. Stoke, I can worry it up to that or is and I climb up his eyes, I can go And I get down on the ground and see this Moss dripping.\n\nThis drop of water. And I tell him that's the brazer rubber. You know, that's just where the phraser River start. It's just a drop of water and another drop of water coming up so you need to protect this drop of water and they're cutting down the horse so you know, that that's how they explain little things and I'm just saying They're nice.\n\nLike they're easy to understand the bigger concept of the importance, right? As opposed to ours, right? Yeah. You need to drink even though we put 17 Olympic-sides pools Spruce, inner drink water every day.\n\nSomething goes going into our water. I'm like, okay, Aquarium. That sounded worse than chlorine. Yeah. Well, okay if I step back from that. Yeah. So how they communicate their values as they hit their resources is through storytelling. Yeah. And the storytelling is a meme of its own. It's a story it's has its own shape and you have to be there for the whole of it.\n\nYeah, and it doesn't translate well into policy. Yeah. And yeah. And it does in their languages even more. So every word is tied to the Earth. There's no words that aren't tied to the Earth. So I'll becomes a little bit banal in that regard. It's not specific enough. Until you break it down and understand.\n\nOr different meanings of a word. Yeah, yeah. Um, We think they're What question you want to ask? I'm just taking it all and I'm taking in like this. Yeah, that to me, that looks like there's a good organizational structure and then you have Uh, relationships in place. Yeah. And then to prove how this works, you could put, because in the past it was at a granular.\n\nLevel of the project, you could show how a pilot project moves through all the way up and also how a pilot project would have started moved all the way down and that would show the information organization and how it works. Then you can take that and say fucked up.\n\nAnd say well what were the objectives? Yeah and and these all organizations all have objectives and they are getting in the way of the information flow because they're objectives are usually people with not that they have concerns. Probably don't need to model that. Yeah, that's where I do when I'm doing money and stuff, but if you model just the ability of information flowing through this, In saying, You know, my objective is this and now I have to go through all of this.\n\nThat gives you know. Yeah that's a good. It gives you something to work with and then from my point of view, I can make that agentic and show you how stupid it is. But I can also make it just something hit a button. Right. Meaning. Okay. Now I know what to do here.\n\nHere's the checklist. Here's the questions. Here's the roadblocks. Here's all the stuff. Yeah. And this is an organizational structure is what I guessed. You have. Um, And the fact that everything is a pilot power project, it makes sense too. And it's all of this doesn't scale. No, it only scales.\n\nIt doesn't scale. It doesn't scale. No. Um, And what is coming in? Is the scale R? And the scalar is. It's a set of values. Values are Are meant to be out. Meeting their storage room. Storings. That's so far away from the pilots and Pilots and Pilots approving. The system, the pilots have proven system.\n\nYeah. And they're saying, yeah, I know, we get it. They're touching the resources. Yeah. Values and resources first. Yeah, so you've got an inversion on that. Your dealing with where none of this is none of this. Does that yeah, none of this? Yeah. Is doing what they're saying. And so you have all of this and even if they're engaging all of this is standing next to this.\n\nYeah. And that's what you can show is that you can do all of this. Yeah. Then you can come to this and it doesn't make any sense. Is like you're suggesting, is that? Yeah. Yeah. And so the question is, Like Michael, but yeah, better go than Whatever I said before, Is.\n\nUplift. This So that people understand it, you can use it and can use our legislation to enact. That's a really cool thing to say. Yeah, right. So Show how this can interface with this in a more effective way for people to understand. Yeah. They may even use. Yeah, so And I okay, so my stuff I do this too.\n\nIt's really kind of cool. You come out from a values point of view, but you'll be able to do you can even come out from a story point of view. Here's the story, take that story. Look at all the documentation associated with getting that story turned into policy. And I do that, if you have a spectrum place to be able to ask it all the questions, So you you have something very interesting at that level, if you say These are.\n\nHere's my examples of what their legislation looks like. How they use it, talk about it, or here, it is documented how they use it two things. Here's our legislation art process, and here's how you use it. Two different things. Again, one's paperwork, once experienced. Um, you have these conversely things, but you can use one to map over the top with the other and go through it.\n\nOr you could ask the system, you have Tell me your stories. Like this sucks. Tell me your stories in this format. Tell me your stories that support the resources at the top.\n\nBecause this is Harper sum but it's a good challenge you're not getting. You're never going to ask people to do that. No, I know but you ask this to do that. Yeah. Um, you can get very specific with people to say, well, this is the story, it's telling with the story is telling is We can't push values through our system, effectively.\n\nBecause it's not system based because it doesn't put the resources at the top. It says. The government's at the top. The reality, the king was at the time. Yeah, the reality is, the taxonomy is not in place for this to happen. It's getting inverted. So if you look up taxonomy and you look up, you know, you're working in a taxonomy.\n\nWhat are the valued hierarchies involved? And you already explain it to me earlier, I say this is how you get to the water and then maybe that's a resource that they want to manage. Whereas like, here's a drop of water. You gotta make sure he gets there. Yeah. Um, those are Converse.\n\nSo, Forgot to mention this piece of legislation because it says, Paul provincial, legislation must align with this can describe the, where does that? So it basically weighs what's it called? Uh, declaration of Rights of indigenous people's act. Okay, so it is he says, We know it's unrip, which is the United Nation thing, which spent, which people around the world spent 30 years to produce.\n\nWe all think we did it. No. We could just people around the world did it. And we kind of said, you know, at the beginning Uh, That acts as all provincial legislation. Must line up to support indigenous, not lies. It doesn't quite see lies, but indigenous values and things and then since yep, line up all provincial legislation.\n\nLocal garments that our body of the local governments will then have to adoptions by adopt changed their biles and support and so in some cases it does flow from In many cases from the provincial government down to the regional body. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. For more stuff. Yeah. Yeah 99.9.\n\nYeah. So that's why these pieces that you found are very effective tools within there that that's why the Conserver has gone in. And number one thing. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so yeah, that's a whole another layer. Yeah. Three. And four long years. Let's get song by boy. Yeah, what I wrote down was organizations objectives projects, strategies policy act.\n\nAnd then I would say values. Um, those are Um, all different things. So I break things down into nouns and verbs and prepositions are like how, how you, how you work. No, you're in front of me. You're behind me, this looks significantly different meanings but um, By looking at things that way.\n\nI could take whatever you two were to collaborate on and if you involved me at the level of, okay, I've looked at some of this, I would be able to take it and structuralize it into something. It'll be very interesting to look at Meaning to analyze it for you, or put it in a framework, where you're analyzing it.\n\nUm, But there's there's stories here, there's user Journeys. You can call them, right? That's my user experience stuff is just like well no. That's my work phone. Yeah, no. It's a workflow. It's a workflow. This is how I get information. Yeah. So if you just This is really, really valuable.\n\nI find I can't do these things unless I have people in front of me. So I don't know if you've been able to do these things on you, you came with yours. Um, but I mean to be able to describe the macro level. Yeah. Um, It being received, this is really valuable and if you take it to some level, where there's And understanding of these circles from objectives or even responsibilities.\n\nOr check boxes. Like some people have like they're just a check box. You know how to describe his mother's approvals.\n\nSo these These are the other Bodies that You know, it's not just us. These guys are doing their a lot of their own things. And trying to do this as well but and we work with them. Yeah. Okay so that's a there's always that other other axis everything's being done elsewhere, the same differently differently and not quite like this is this is great under capacity.\n\nNo, to do what they know what they need to do. So if they had a framework, they'd be more effective, just like the past employees, you gave them framework and now they could do their thing. And so what they resent is that for 50 years, these guys have been giving millions of dollars every year to be the water stewards of the region, where their culture.\n\nAll right, so they talk about concerns, right? Yeah. So all this stuff, all this Scott, Those concerns drive all of this, most likely, right? So, I say, objectives and responsibilities and even outputs, and inputs. Those are. I usually just look at that, like, inputs. Do something output. Input. Asshole.\n\nNo output. Um, so that's an even more significant thing is that One of the things that I've recognized is that, if you're in a green, a Greenfield space, you're solving a problem. You should solve the problem in a repeatable way. And if you can give it away, You're winning.\n\nAnd, I'm giving everything I do away to anybody who can use it. And it's because tomorrow is better because of it. And I think if you can come up with some understanding of this and say you're under facility, here's four of the areas where our stuff Maps to you take that run with it.\n\nOh yeah. Then not only is it like you know you're not doing it. It's like we've analyzed this and this is not even this is the strategy. Because, My concern for you has been in 12 of you, too. I don't know, you well enough in your earlier in your careers, like when you go You go, man and afterwards.\n\nI have very little confidence Next Generations because they didn't go out there and do what we did. And that's just real. Yeah. And um, I'm losing that though. I I think I'd never be able to retire because I couldn't see the new generation come along but I see it.\n\nOkay.\n\nIs that your knowledge stops? Yeah, right? And you put fucking whole lifetime into it. And that's my thing is like you leave in that. Much expert domain, knowledge. Yeah, you leave you come back as a consultant and you're not engaged and because you have to move on and your life too you know and you're at the point where you're you're recognizing this at a higher level.\n\nAnd so crystallizing some of this Because you've done all the documentation. Yeah you've had to have all your meetings transcribed. You had to communicate all the agendas. Yeah. Because you're just knowledge workers, right? We don't we don't have anything else other than the trackability of that. We've done something.\n\nYeah, and that means you've got proof on paper. And so now it's time to take The wisdom. Yeah. And use that. So you're you captured the whole thing that I see is an opportunity. In in, in whatever intelligence she brought to the table. My big thing is whatever we're doing here isn't what we do.\n\nThat's what you did before you came here. And you proved it. You already knew all this. So, This. This is from my point of view. I, I can reflect back on it and provide you some understanding of it. Um that is guidance around a strategies on how to do your work.\n\nThat's what I've studied work. Just the idea of work for two years. And um, Now, I'm stuck as a programmer, so Which is applying that. But what I can do is I'll spend an hour with my tools and I'll provide you a view on what you've said. And if you capture this, And you take the transcript I give you and you put both into charge your VT then you give it like a couple of really good questions.\n\nLike I need to have a strategy on how to understand how to put this information in some like even that. Yeah. Just like making a digestible. Yeah, that's it. You just say like or how about this you put this diagram in here and then yeah, you put the transcript together.\n\nHe's like, can you help me understand how to communicate diagram like or understand anything? And it will do something and I have really good ways of making it do good stuff, yeah, but if you use clawed AI, Excellent. Oh yeah. And if you use the open AI 01 model.\n\nIt's excellent for the Strategic stuff. Um, It's about giving yourself feedback loots, right? You work in spreadsheets. It's like people who work in spreadsheets. That's our feedback. Okay, math. It looks like it's okay. Don't give me, okay?\n\nBut what I that's how people are exciting. Oh, Scott's work is like I gotta get dwells but for him it's like I gotta get a spreadsheet done. It's very cheap. There's one target here. It's 17 Pages. Okay. Oh, so I found this out, too. If there's no system in place, you'll use paper or, and if there's no software in place, you'll use spreadsheets Yeah, spreadsheets tools.\n\nI made this tool. I'm like there's a do\n\nInformation. I don't know. What more I can get. Yeah, no. Even you talking Dave it's clearing. My thoughts of what's up. My next time like I stopped doing to do this, because it's too big, it's too big. I can't operate on to do this. Like so. Do you do mind mapping?\n\nIt's because you did this, it's super powerful because it's fast and you don't have to do it, right? And you just want to get it all out and then you drag and drop and use like, oh, I ended up with like one part of this really big in the rest of my.\n\nWow. This is the problem. But, My mapping is a, if you have too much to do this master list, whatever you want to call them, you don't work. Then my maps. Allow you to dump. Yeah. And in a structure, That's kind of it coming out way. And for years, I did them and I was lost.\n\nI'd go right there. Try to share them in everybody's like nah. He was like, it's everything I got right there. But, This isn't my map. Yeah, and it allows you to add Dimensions like you can say oh people Yeah. Concerns not the people. Yeah. Yeah, and then you can map things like, oh, documents associated with people.\n\nMy maps are really good for building out and understanding of the flow. You can see. If one department has a lot, one bubble has a lot, then there's likely the most You know, where you put your effort? Yeah. And if one bubble has nothing, that might be your opportunity.\n\nAgain, by having somebody on this side of the table, you don't know unless you put it in a certain kind of structure. Yeah. But, Um, I see the layered cake. Yeah, I see you having like layers of things and there's like Stuff. Moving on each layer. Yeah. And fortunately, there is no if we if this Close out like how we've got a designed?\n\nThere's no higher level to stop us. Yeah, that's sorry. I think that's great from the pilot's point of view where. Yeah, you know, you can get things done, where people are experiencing yeah to The highest level you can work, at is the level of invisibility and this values. Yeah, it is like the respect of life.\n\nYeah. If you that's your job, like Cynthia's job. Yeah. She's that's not her experience her feeding people. Yeah. That's the highest thing you can do. Yeah. So if you can get there and you say, the values are driving by motivations I can help you show them. Here's the motivations and strategy.\n\nHere's the criteria. The criteria has doculus to support. Um, We we communicated and respected way. And then you say, this is how we do that. You guys have all that nases? Yeah. Yeah. How you communicate engage. I'm Cut myself short. Okay. Um, Yeah. Yeah.",

      "result": "The conversation primarily revolved around several key priorities related to environmental conservation, governance, and policy development, particularly within the context of First Nations and local governments in British Columbia. Here are the main priorities discussed:\n\n1. **Government to Government Body/Leadership:**\n   - **Target:** Establishing a governing body that allows for co-management and the co-creation of policies that significantly impact the environment. This body should align with the water sustainability plan, ensuring that it is led by both First Nations and local governments.\n   - **Why it Matters:** It empowers First Nations and helps create a more inclusive and comprehensive governance structure that can lead to better environmental stewardship at a larger scale.\n\n2. **Connectivity and Biodiversity:**\n   - **Target:** Conservation planning to keep landscapes from being fragmented, which supports biodiversity. Key projects mentioned that relate to this include the Okanagan Conservation Planning Tool and the Central Okanagan Regional Biodiversity Strategy.\n   - **Why it Matters:** Preventing fragmentation is crucial for protecting habitats and maintaining the health of ecosystems, which in turn supports biodiversity and environmental sustainability.\n\n3. **Water Responsibility Plan:**\n   - **Target:** Developing a water responsibility plan based on both Western and Indigenous laws, with the aim to manage and protect watersheds effectively.\n   - **Why it Matters:** Water is a critical resource for all forms of life, and protecting watersheds ensures its sustainable use and availability, aligning with Indigenous stewardship principles.\n\n4. **Policy and Legislative Change:**\n   - **Target:** Influencing and adapting policies that support environmental conservation and Indigenous law. The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act was mentioned as an overarching piece of legislation that requires provincial laws to align with Indigenous values.\n   - **Why it Matters:** Leveraging legislative frameworks can drive systemic change and support long-term conservation goals, ensuring that Indigenous values are respected and integrated into environmental policies.\n\n5. **Resource Management:**\n   - **Target:** Understanding and implementing changes to resource allocations, like annual allowable cuts in forestry, using different legislative tools in collaboration with legal experts.\n   - **Why it Matters:** Proper resource management is foundational for sustainable development and conservation, preventing over-exploitation of natural resources.\n\nThese priorities matter because they are focused on sustainable environmental management, incorporating Indigenous values, and creating systems that allow for effective governance and policy change. Ensuring that these targets are met can lead to more resilient ecosystems, protected biodiversity, and empowered communities.",

      "result": "Clear objectives are essential for guiding projects, initiatives, or organizational efforts towards desired outcomes. The SMART criteria provide a framework for defining these objectives clearly and effectively. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Here is a breakdown of each criterion:\n\n1. **Specific**: Objectives should be clear and specific. They should answer the questions: \n   - What needs to be accomplished?\n   - Who is responsible for it?\n   - What steps need to be taken?\n   Example: Instead of saying \"Improve water quality,\" a specific objective would be \"Reduce industrial pollutants in the local river by 20%.\"\n\n2. **Measurable**: Objectives must have criteria for measuring progress and success. This involves defining the key performance indicators (KPIs) or metrics.\n   Example: \"Achieve a 20% reduction in pollutants,\" which can be measured using water quality tests.\n\n3. **Achievable**: Objectives should be realistic and attainable. They should be challenging yet feasible given the resources and constraints.\n   Example: \"Reduce pollutants by 20%\" may be achievable with the current technology and budget, whereas \"Reduce by 100%\" could be unrealistic in the short term.\n\n4. **Relevant**: Objectives should align with broader goals and strategies. They should be pertinent to the overall mission and priorities.\n   Example: The objective \"Reduce industrial pollutants by 20%\" should align with a broader goal of improving environmental health and sustainability.\n\n5. **Time-bound**: Objectives must have a clear deadline or timeframe for achievement.\n   Example: \"Reduce industrial pollutants in the river by 20% within the next 12 months.\"\n\nTo set these objectives, organizations typically engage stakeholders and experts to ensure alignment and feasibility. This often involves brainstorming sessions, prioritization exercises, and consultations to gather input and consensus.\n\nThe specific and measurable nature of SMART objectives allows for effective tracking and evaluation, making them essential tools for successful project management and strategic planning.",

      "result": "The conversation revolves around several high-level strategies, customer journey considerations, and prioritization efforts related to conservation, governance, and effective knowledge sharing. Here's a breakdown of the key strategies discussed:\n\n### High-Level Strategies:\n1. **Co-creation of Governance Structures:**\n   - The creation of new government-to-government bodies is emphasized. These bodies are intended to provide leadership on conservation and water-related issues and are seen as central to achieving long-term goals like protecting the environment and aligning policies and principles.\n\n2. **Policy and Legislative Engagement:**\n   - The use of existing legislative frameworks, such as British Columbia's Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (DRIPA) and the Water Sustainability Act, is considered crucial. These frameworks offer avenues for making substantial policy changes, like reducing annual allowable cuts in forestry or addressing mining impacts.\n\n3. **Knowledge Management and Communication:**\n   - The conversation highlights the importance of using AI and personas to tailor communication strategies to different audiences. This involves transforming complex conservation and governance data into digestible formats for policymakers, funders, and local communities.\n\n4. **Continuous Learning and Adaptation:**\n   - Stakeholders need to understand higher-level Indigenous stewardship values that integrate environmental, cultural, and social considerations. Learning these values is seen largely through storytelling and collaboration with Indigenous partners.\n\n### Customer (Stakeholder) Journey:\n1. **Engagement with First Nations:**\n   - Building strong relationships with Indigenous communities is critical. The dialogue touches on learning and integrating First Nations' environmental stewardship values and laws.\n\n2. **Multi-stakeholder Collaborations:**\n   - Involvement of various regional bodies, funders, and local governments in conservation projects is key to achieving broader support and implementing tangible measures. There's an emphasis on collaboration to overcome constraints due to a lack of formal authority in decision-making.\n\n### Prioritization:\n1. **Aligning Activities with High-Level Objectives:**\n   - The work being done is mapped to align with overarching goals, such as connectivity and water protection. This involves strategic engagement and agreement at higher political levels to streamline efforts and eliminate inefficiencies.\n\n2. **Resource and Work Flow Organization:**\n   - The flow of information is structured to ensure that insights and knowledge gained at operational levels effectively inform policy-making, and vice-versa. This is especially critical in ensuring new strategies like the water responsibility plan and connectivity projects align with the intended outcomes.\n\n3. **Balancing Long-term and Short-term Initiatives:**\n   - There's a need to balance pilot projects and regional conservation efforts with broader, long-term policy changes. This enables immediate biodiversity conservation benefits while progressing toward larger-scale policy transformations.\n\nThese strategies illustrate a complex interplay between local conservation actions, legislative engagement, governance reforms, and knowledge dissemination, all aimed at effectively addressing environmental challenges while respecting indigenous knowledge and perspectives.",
