And your name is Sandy? \n\n01:48Sandy ReiterYes. \n\n01:49David OlssonAll right. Awesome. Thank you for spending time on Sunday night. And speaking of night, whereabouts in the country are you located? \n\n02:00Sandy ReiterI am in colona British Columbia. Where are you located? \n\n02:06David OlssonSame thing. This is easy. I think we're going to get done quickly here. Well, thanks for taking time tonight. My name is David Olsen, and I worked at Comic 47 labs and we're doing research, QHR technologies, and they provide services for service providers in the healthcare system as well as patients. And tonight I think you're a nurse. \n\n02:31Sandy ReiterYeah. \n\n02:31David OlssonOkay. So I'm getting things right, the easy stuff. Anyways, I kind of like to get to know your experience within a clinic environment. \n\n02:41Sandy ReiterYes, that's right. \n\n02:44David OlssonThere's all my checkboxes, actually. I just have a few more. So I kind of just want to get to know your experience. And we do need to be observant of privacy concerns around patients and yourself. So if we're talking about a patient that has a condition and they get something prescribed to them, we can just say the doctor has seen them and prescribed something rather than say they've gotten Capoten or any specific treatment that makes sense. So we're talking about their process, not the specifics of a patient's concerns. And that just helps us. We do anonymize the information and before it gets used by the team for veterans services. And so we will go through that process at the end and at the end of this process. Okay. One more thing. \n\n03:33Sandy ReiterYes. \n\n03:34David OlssonDid you sign a consent form yet? \n\n03:37Sandy ReiterNo, I didn't. \n\n03:38David OlssonOkay. And my apologies. That's our process right now because we're trying to get everything done before Christmas and we're talking on Sunday, right? \n\n03:48Sandy ReiterThat's how crazy it is. \n\n03:50David OlssonYes. At the end of this, one of my compadres will be sending an email with consent form, and then your $250 e transfer will fall. \n\n04:01Sandy ReiterOkay. \n\n04:03David OlssonBut between now and then, we're going to spend around 45 minutes and I'm basically done. I just kind of would like to maybe get to know what your role is if we could start there and sort of understand. I know days aren't typical, but one of my roles is to figure out what's different to maybe what is kind of similar. Okay, I am now going to listen if I could just ask you to describe your role and maybe your responsibilities. \n\n04:33Sandy ReiterOkay. So I work in a family physicians clinic. So there are seven physicians that work in the clinic, and I am hired as their nurse. So it's called the primary care network. You're probably familiar with that. Maybe or maybe not. But basically the initiative is to hire nurses in clinics to offload off of physicians because of the shortage that we're experiencing with patients not having their own family doctor. So I've done this role now for, well, June of this year would have been a year, so a year in about four or five months. So they've created a little spot where I work, a little room where I work. A typical day would be I pull up my schedule and within that schedule, either the doctors or the front staff book in patients for me to see. \n\n05:30Sandy ReiterSo I've got whatever is within my registered nurse capacity role and deemed appropriate from the doctor's perspective. So things they want to offload on me that then sort of becomes like the doctor's order and then I can do those things. Definitely was a sort of agreed upon list, so to speak, of things as this was new for the clinic to have a nurse, can I say, were. \n\n05:57David OlssonYou involved with that process of agreed upon stuff? \n\n06:00Sandy ReiterYes, absolutely. In fact, I created a list for them, they actually had one for me. And so then we talked about different things. They actually showed me a few things. My background was obstetric, so labor and delivery babies, and then I went straight to a community job where I did elderly people. So then this sort of falls in the middle and a lot of things they needed me to do, I hadn't done before, but still within my scope, so yes, things that they were able to show me and then I can do. \n\n06:31David OlssonYou just mentioned more than one clinic. Have you worked in more than one clinic? \n\n06:36Sandy ReiterNo, I have not. I was in community, like a health unit, prior job, so not really a clinic. \n\n06:46David OlssonAnd that was prior experience. But you had two different prior experiences? \n\n06:49Sandy ReiterYes. \n\n06:51David OlssonCool. This agreed upon list of things to do, and I'm trying to summarize right. \n\n07:01Sandy ReiterNow. \n\n07:04David OlssonYou get it from the doctors and from possibly the front staff agreed upon by the doctor. Patients come to the front desk. \n\n07:13Sandy ReiterYeah. Check in like they normally do. \n\n07:15David OlssonOkay, so nothing different in the path that they would normally have in front of them? \n\n07:20Sandy ReiterNo. \n\n07:20David OlssonOkay. When they're booking, are they expecting, who are they expecting to see? \n\n07:26Sandy ReiterFor the most part they book with I'm going to see Sandy. A lot of times it comes from a previous visit, like they've seen a warped and I can help get rid of that ward. Okay, book with Sandy for your next visit. A handful of times we've had maybe a physician sick with all the things that are going around and we need to scramble and try to see as many patients as we can. And again, within my scope, I can help out. I've had to do that. So yes, a handful of times a patient will come in and go, oh, I didn't know I was seeing the nurse. Clearly they can refuse or they can say, I don't want to. Most of the time it's things I am proficient at, obviously. If not, I'm not going to do something I can't. \n\n08:15Sandy ReiterAnd so generally it's been fine, but yes. Most of the time, they know they're. \n\n08:19David OlssonSeeing the nurse, and it sounds like it might be different experience for different patients and for you. How is that. \n\n08:29Sandy ReiterTo see the patient when they don't know they're coming to see yeah. Usually what I end up doing, to be completely honest, is I say, I'm sorry, I am the nurse. The physician is away. In most cases, the physician has actually or they've had a phone call from the front staff, or the physician has called them directly and let them know they're not super surprised. \n\n09:00David OlssonAll interesting things are interesting to me. \n\n09:03Sandy ReiterOkay. \n\n09:05David OlssonThat's kind of what I'm looking at, too, is like things that it was neat that you have this agreed upon workflow or set of works that you can do. And are there other things that are unique to this position within the clinic environment? Because you're new to this position, correct? \n\n09:23Sandy ReiterYeah. So throughout my day two, they call them tasks. So there's things that they can send me to do, such as call a patient with lab results, give me a little project to work on, such as find out the resources of this within colona. And so then in between patients, I'm never generally booked solid, so to speak, in my day. So within those times of little breaks is when I can do those tasks and they send me those via the electronic system so I can click on those, look at it. Depending on how much time I have, I can work on those throughout the day. So that's another clinic unique, which is good. Right. They can sort of get me to do little things, and as I in my day, I do them. \n\n10:15David OlssonThat's actually quite unique. That really changes my view of your role. \n\n10:20Sandy ReiterGood. Yeah, it's really good. And so really, as far as downtime, when I first started the job, it was definitely a thing of I think it was also a learning curve. How do they use me? How does the nurse even get accepted in an office where patients aren't used to it? Right. So there's some of that I had to get used to. And then, you know, as the months go by, you know, you get in your day and it's the typical you'll wonder how you're going to get it all done. So that is not new at all. Yeah. \n\n10:54David OlssonYou got to the part that, okay, there's a common thread, and so you have your scheduled stuff, like your appointments and then this other thing, and you kind of describe it differently right there. \n\n11:07Sandy ReiterWhat was the other thing? \n\n11:08David OlssonWell, all these other tasks, they're not scheduled. \n\n11:13Sandy ReiterThat's right. Yeah. \n\n11:14David OlssonAnd my guess is they grow or. \n\n11:17Sandy ReiterYeah, I would say they ebb and flow. Definitely. I would say just the workload in general has grown more as I've been grown into the role, and it's more that, but yes, I would say those tasks I find ebb and flow as maybe things come up. \n\n11:40David OlssonCan you describe what kind of doctor you work with? Is it gen? GB? \n\n11:44Sandy ReiterYes. \n\n11:45David OlssonOkay. Are there other doctors in the clinic that aren't GPS? Are there other doctors at all in the clinic? \n\n11:52Sandy ReiterYes, but they're all general practitioners. \n\n11:55David OlssonOkay. \n\n11:55Sandy ReiterAll of them are there are seven of them, but not working simultaneously all the time. Okay. So the most they might have is four on a given day. Generally two to four? Two to four on a given day. \n\n12:18David OlssonYou work for one doctor? \n\n12:20Sandy ReiterI work for all of them. I am hired in the clinic as the nurse for all the doctors. \n\n12:27David OlssonThis is much clearer for me. \n\n12:29Sandy ReiterOkay. Sorry if I'm not no. \n\n12:33David OlssonThat'S what's good about these conversations. I got the questions right at the beginning. Right. They were very easy. \n\n12:39Sandy ReiterYes. \n\n12:42David OlssonThis is very interesting. Okay. So you have four doctors. \n\n12:49Sandy ReiterSeven altogether, but on a given day, physically, there's anywhere from two to four in the. \n\n12:55David OlssonYou work with seven? \n\n12:56Sandy ReiterYes. Correct. \n\n12:58David OlssonAnd there's front desk. Is there a front desk as well? Yes. \n\n13:02Sandy ReiterLike they call them the MOAS or those ones? Yes. \n\n13:06David OlssonAnd how many are there for the seven? \n\n13:10Sandy ReiterI mean, probably one, two, three. Like maybe three to four. You need a couple that run and grab the patients into the rooms and a couple that are in the front end that answer the phones. \n\n13:23David OlssonOkay. And your tasks, do you engage with other clinics or do you engage with other parts of the healthcare system, like labs and stuff like that? \n\n13:34Sandy ReiterYes, I do. Okay. \n\n13:38David OlssonAre you initiating things retrieving? Like, what is that engagement usually, like. \n\n13:44Sandy ReiterWith other say if it's a lab? Say if it's a lab. I've not really had to call the lab, per se, a lot because you can just fax blood work to them. So it's not necessarily I mean, I've had to do it once to organize mobile lab to come to a patient who is homebound. So then more my process of trying to figure out how they do that. \n\n14:14David OlssonOkay, but you did help me out there. You engaged with the labs via fax or something like that? \n\n14:21Sandy ReiterYeah, in this case, I did have to call because I really wanted to talk to a person. \n\n14:26David OlssonIt doesn't fit in the fax workflow or whatever. \n\n14:29Sandy ReiterThat's right. Or I'd never done it before. \n\n14:31David OlssonSo those times I talked to fax technology okay. How's that? \n\n14:42Sandy ReiterSince I'm not very techy, that can be a challenge. But those MOAS are gold, so they are super good, and it's worth having a good relationship with them. I get along with them well. My room is actually right sort of across from them, so I can literally wave to them throughout my day, and I ask them a lot of questions. \n\n15:04David OlssonOkay, so it sounds like there's support for you. You do the outreach and then you get this. \n\n15:10Sandy ReiterYeah, I guess I'm just trying to. \n\n15:13David OlssonUnderstand because everybody's busy but then there's all these other wonderful things that go on, right? Like they're supporting you. Like I'm trying to summarize here. You'll be able to offload from the doctors by taking on certain tasks and in some ways they have that support. \n\n15:31Sandy ReiterRole with you, correct? \n\n15:33David OlssonMaybe in smaller ways, but maybe I can ask. This is interesting. How does your job make you feel? \n\n15:47Sandy ReiterThat's a good question. All this is confidential, right? \n\n15:56David OlssonYes, like I said, it is confidential for sure. And we anonymized it. Right? And we use transcripts. \n\n16:05Sandy ReiterOkay. \n\n16:08David OlssonIt's fair for you to just not have answer for me that's like you have your job and you go to it every day. \n\n16:18Sandy ReiterYeah. How does it make me feel? I've never been asked that before. So I've done this work now for 20 plus years. I've done different things that fulfill me in different ways. This fulfills me in I guess I'll just say honestly, I'm in my mid forty s. I used to do shift work. That was probably the highlight of my work was when I could deliver a baby, the thrill of it. But I'm past the days and nights and twelve hour shifts. The clinic where I work now, I worked with all those doctors for 14 years. I know them all very well. And it was a AI transcription to be able to still do some of that work that I did. \n\n17:07Sandy ReiterI mean, I'm not delivering babies in the clinics or that kind of thing, but I can still do some of that prenatal kind of work. But in a setting where it's a Monday to Friday, 8 hours, weekends or weekends. Can I tell you all this stuff? I feel like no, you can. \n\n17:24David OlssonThis is great. You have full confidentiality. \n\n17:27Sandy ReiterOkay. So yes, I would say in my role is very different than what I'm used to. A lot of sitting computer work, talking on the phone, which I think for me I'm very hands on. I like to run around and do things, but my body can't necessarily handle that so much more. This job came to me, I didn't know it existed. I had heard about it just through others. So it was a good way to try to do something, to still get some good longevity and work full time in this field. So how does it make me feel? I think I talked around that I think for the most part it's perfect for me right now. \n\n18:14Sandy ReiterI think some days are good, some days are you feel frustrated because it's pulling aside of me that I didn't necessarily want to always do stare in front of the computer and sit. But I can also see the goods in it and that outweighs the cons. So yes, on a given day, I would say I walk away and I'm like okay, that was a good day. Yeah, it's a long answer. \n\n18:42David OlssonThat was awesome. That was great. Thank you. I almost said something. He just kept going and, like, thank you. No, that was wonderful. And I got to say, I feel pretty good if no one's asked you that question before and you answered that way. \n\n18:59Sandy ReiterOkay. \n\n19:01David OlssonThat's quite a response because I can read into you want to keep being a nurse. \n\n19:06Sandy ReiterYeah, absolutely. It's the right thing for me to do. And I guess what I like, too, is to be able to do different things. Right. To be able to have worked in very different areas. And I think that's what's pretty neat about what I do. \n\n19:22David OlssonVery cool. And because of this newness, maybe I can ask you mentioned the computer, and that's a component of what you do. I'm just wondering how it plays in your day, because you made it sound different. \n\n19:37Sandy ReiterRight, okay. \n\n19:38David OlssonOr it's a component of your day. I'm just wondering how you engage with the team and what you use for communication, because you have the patience that you see, then you have this new part of your job, the tax. \n\n19:58Sandy ReiterSo definitely in the clinic, you're in the clinic. You're physically there. So if I need to talk to a doctor, there's a messaging system that we use. I feel like our communication is very good. I can go up to them. I can ask them. I can pull them out of a room if I want to, if I need to. I shouldn't say if I want to, but clearly they're busy day, so I appreciate that. But what I'm also part of which is very interesting is the primary care network, so we have access to social workers, physios, dietitians, and that whole part that I work with and for essentially, is all virtual. Right. So we have meetings where we have monthly meetings that are together with everybody. \n\n20:48Sandy ReiterThey've started doing them now in person, but basically this whole program was started in the world of COVID So it also amazed me at how much you can accomplish when it's virtual. You're just sitting in your chair, and you don't have to go anywhere. There is a plethora of efficiencies that can actually happen. So, yes, a lot of our meetings, all of them at the beginning were zoom or teams. As much as I'm not a fan of that, because I love the in person, I am just amazed at how efficient you can be when you haven't even moved, because you can make a phone call, you can talk quickly. And I have a computer that I use that's just for purposes from interior health, so I can talk to you and I can quickly look up something, and that's perfect. \n\n21:39Sandy ReiterSo, yes, a lot of my job is being able to network through those means, which I never thought I would love it, but I can see there's huge benefits in it. Right. \n\n21:54David OlssonWow, that's great. It sounds like it helped the network. \n\n22:02Sandy ReiterI mean, you'd never be able to launch a brand new program like what we did without the use of technology, because it happened within COVID. It was within that time period, and they were able to get things up and running. And you had to be there for your meetings. And as long as you were there, you could discuss things. Right. In a world where I don't know how you would have done it had you not had a computer. \n\n22:28David OlssonRight, right. Yeah. That would have been very weird. How the meetings have continued. Has the practices continued that you established in this remote? \n\n22:39Sandy ReiterYeah, we have one monthly meeting with everybody, so all the Allied Health everybody, and that is now just started in person. But those were always Zoom or our Ms teams, I think it's called. Whatever, but that idea, this kind of thing, right? \n\n23:01David OlssonYeah. Interesting. So in these calls, are you doing one one? It sounds like you're doing conferences or meeting calls. \n\n23:12Sandy ReiterYes. But you can do one ones. I talk with our social worker sometimes. It feels like daily if things come through and he's very available, so we send referrals to them. But generally we can sort of talk about a patient that we have, again, being sort of growing in this role. Is this an appropriate referral? And I can hop on a call with him right away and say, okay, what about this? So that's being really good. \n\n23:39David OlssonWell, that's great. If I use the word, it helps you be responsive, is that right? \n\n23:44Sandy ReiterYes. And supportive also. It's interesting sort of feeling like you're alone in the clinic. Actually, I was really thought that would be something I would love, because I was used to being in an environment where everyone is at you all the time in the nurse's station and patients, and here I'm in a clinic, and I've never thought I would actually say that. Oh, you actually feel kind of alone because you're the only nurse. You can't sort of tap the nurse beside you who's feet away and say, what about this? But having that technology where you can text somebody right. The next nurse in the clinic is down the street. I never see her, but I can also just quickly text her. Or I could. \n\n24:33David OlssonThat's interesting. So you said you never see her, but you text her. \n\n24:37Sandy ReiterYes. \n\n24:41David OlssonIs that the case with many of these people that you're on call with? Yeah. \n\n24:45Sandy ReiterOkay. \n\n24:46David OlssonLike, you and I don't we're in Colonial. That was neat. \n\n24:50Sandy ReiterYeah, absolutely. \n\n24:51David OlssonI talked to people from Nova Scotia okay. And stuff like that. And that would be very late for them. Interesting. So your job is quite interesting. And do you have peers like yourself? And you mentioned you can do that. Do you interact in any other way with them? \n\n25:13Sandy ReiterLike, any other way? Like I don't know. \n\n25:15David OlssonYour role seems unique, and there may be 20 sandies. \n\n25:20Sandy ReiterI mean, there are about 16 of us. I can't even remember how many numbers within our region that do the same type of rule as me. Every clinic is different though, right? Every doctor utilizes their nurses, so the flavor in each clinic is going to be different. \n\n25:41David OlssonOkay. \n\n25:41Sandy ReiterBut similar a little bit in the fact that we're all nurses and we're working for doctors and they see patients. So however they utilize the nurse is going to be what they normally see or it's time consuming for them that they find. Right, yes. \n\n26:01David OlssonI'm going to go with that as metaphor. Analogy is good, and thank you for helping me with that because that's what I'm looking to understand. One sounds like you are very unique and in this situation, you are one among many in your clinic. But to know that you are going to be unique, even if there's another clinic that put the same number of people, the same number of doctors and all that, using the same software and ratios and all that stuff. So that's also a very interesting thing that happens in health care. And maybe I could ask you about your experience that way. It's the uniqueness of clinics with doctors and you have different workflows and different responsibilities. I don't know from the outside, people have a different expectation of a clinic, maybe. \n\n27:05Sandy ReiterYeah, okay. Like patients, you mean? \n\n27:07David OlssonYeah, or even myself. When I think of clinics I'm like, which one would I go to and would I understand the difference, how they work? And would that matter to me? \n\n27:21Sandy ReiterI don't think it really should because you're seeing a doctor, you're seeing a general practitioner. In our particular clinic, you're going to get a lot of moms and babies because that's what they are heavy in is the maternity care. So, yes, the odd male patient I do see, and I see more now than I ever have, but they'll sometimes comment. Right, but that is the flavor of our clinic versus maybe the one down the street that just seems to have more chronic diseases. Or. \n\n28:02David OlssonIf I can summarize, do you think the demographic helps with that flavor? Is that a big factor? Like if it's obstetrics and inference compared to elderly care or different 25 years experience? These are not normally the questions I ask. \n\n28:22Sandy ReiterOkay. \n\n28:22David OlssonYou have a very unique experience, and I'm just curious about that. \n\n28:27Sandy ReiterWhat's the question? \n\n28:29David OlssonBecause you talk about the flavor, right. Do the patients like the doctors that you work with? They're dealing with obsessed and babies and that seems to be, as a category, different than elderly people or anything like different demographics. \n\n28:50Sandy ReiterI would say yes. \n\n28:52David OlssonAnd I'm just wondering how that influences your job or does that make it different for other peers and what you interact with them? \n\n29:00Sandy ReiterI mean, different for my colleagues, my nursing colleagues. So it's going to be different in how I talk about my day with them. Okay, definitely. I wanted to work in this clinic because of my background and the fact that I still love that work. So, yes, that was definitely something that when I heard about this clinic and this job, I knew the doctors and I thought, if I'm going to go somewhere, this is where I want to go. Because I can still fulfill the love of that I used to do for that long. But then I can also get pulled in other directions, which is also, I think, pretty healthy, too, is just doing something you haven't done or pulling out those from way back when that you remember learning in school and never really had to do. So that's been good. \n\n29:53David OlssonOkay, just click analogy. I'm trying to learn grade eleven calculus. Don't go there. Maybe with what you got going on. Go there. \n\n30:02Sandy ReiterWho knows to you. \n\n30:03David OlssonNo, but I appreciate your response. That's amazing. And I guess maybe I could ask a few questions from the patient's point of view and how they come in. They come to see you. You do things and whatnot, but then there's other things that your interaction with them. Is it different here in this environment compared to working at the health center? Or is there a uniqueness to this experience or generality to it? \n\n30:42Sandy ReiterI guess it's different because it's just a different job. Right. They're coming in to a doctor's clinic versus where I worked in the community job. I actually did home visits. So that was a completely different type of thing. Right. And then came back and then typed everything up versus the hospital right. Where they're sick and they're right. So yes, it is very different. Is that what you mean? Yeah. \n\n31:10David OlssonNo, I'm trying to appreciate from patients perspective, from your experience with them, because you're dealing with different types of patients, too. For instance, in some clinics, MOA based on demographics have a tough time earning their trust to get information based on where they come from. That's just an instance. And you have challenges of communication with different ethnicity groups in other cases, and. \n\n31:40Sandy ReiterThese are just instances. Yeah. Okay. \n\n31:45David OlssonIt's Sunday night. I'll be alive. That should have been easier for me to relate. \n\n31:50Sandy ReiterOkay, so basically earning a patient's trust. \n\n31:53David OlssonOr are there challenges in the communication or are there different parts of that? Right? \n\n31:57Sandy ReiterYes. I would say yes. That is very different than what I was used to. Yes, for sure. Because if a patient comes in to see their doctor, they want to see their doctor. They don't want to see the nurse, necessarily. Yeah. That is 100% completely different than what I've ever experienced. Is yes, earning the trust of the patient. Is that what you mean? \n\n32:25David OlssonYeah. Well, I was getting at what was involved, but you've distilled it. I don't have to summarize that. But maybe I could ask you a little bit about the how, because it's a big concept. Right. And with people are difficult so how do you establish trust when maybe, like you said, maybe their expectation is a doctor right. Or anything else? \n\n32:53Sandy ReiterHow do I get their trust? I mean, definitely it hasn't been perfect as far as even things when I was learning at this clinic, right. Things that I did, where I was like, oh, I should have actually done it another way. Right. So there is just the learning curve and the confidence that you exude when you're not sure of you haven't done it enough times yet. So I think a patient can pick that up. Maybe not, but I think that and then also some of the stuff I do is like mental health now, so it's a very vulnerable patient that they might say, sandy, I just need you to support them a little bit so you can create a bit of a relationship in the fact that you call them and I make sure that it's reciprocated. Right. \n\n33:46Sandy ReiterDo you want me to call you back? Do you want or not? That's okay, too. So I try to give them the control a little bit, or if they've come to see me in the clinic and I'm brand new to them, sometimes, I will say, okay, should we book you in for your next appointment? They don't have to see me if they don't want to. They have an out for I don't know. Does that make sense? \n\n34:15David OlssonYeah, I would say you're trying to prompt them. \n\n34:18Sandy ReiterYeah. I think there is a level of it's new. It's a new concept to not see the doctor. So am I as proficient as them? They are the physician and I am the nurse, so those roles are very different. \n\n34:37David OlssonThat's very interesting. And time usually helps. \n\n34:43Sandy ReiterYes, that's actually so good. Thanks for saying that. What a patient does like, though, is that I have that flexibility in my schedule. I can see them sooner and I can take more time with them, which some patients lap that up like you wouldn't believe, because they just come and they just need ten or 15 more minutes, and they can't get that. Or I can offer certain things, like, I'll talk to the doctor for you on your behalf, and I'll be that middle person for you. So sometimes they kind of like that relationship, and they can get through to their doctor quicker than if they would wait two or three weeks to see them. So I can do it in a neat way. I think I can offer things to the patient that they wouldn't necessarily be able to get if I wasn't there. \n\n35:36Sandy ReiterSo I can learn from that and learn how I can. But yes, it's an interesting experience, trying to prove your trust or get your trust. Yeah. \n\n35:48David OlssonYou touched on a whole lot of things there, so thank you for that. Because you want to get them into the right behavior to understand that you're doing well by them. It. Sounds like repeated coming back to you. \n\n36:05Sandy ReiterYes. \n\n36:10David OlssonAnd do you find overall, what is the reception? \n\n36:15Sandy ReiterYour feedback good, although somebody told me once, and it was one of the MOAS who said the patient left and was not happy with however it went unbeknownst to me. I don't know who they are, but yes. But I would say, for the most part, I try to obviously be what they need. And if they're not happy to give them that, to hold it loosely and to say, okay, if you need to talk to the doctor or that's your comfort level, that's fine. I'm not going to take it. \n\n36:50David OlssonYou mentioned the unique part of your job. It sounds like you're problem solving or something or you're facilitating. \n\n36:58Sandy ReiterYeah, I like that. \n\n37:01David OlssonOkay. That is unique to the people. \n\n37:10Sandy ReiterI think it is, because I find because my schedule can be a little bit flexible, they can give me a patient, so to speak, and say, I need you to just see where they're at. Basically, it's a very sometimes it's a loose request. Like like this patient is very needy, for lack of a better word. Okay. I don't mean to say it in about, but just more I only have ten minutes in my day to deal with them. They want an hour. But if you could somehow support them and give them maybe a few things that they need, I wonder if their health could improve down the road because they're just being supported. \n\n37:51Sandy ReiterAnd so that kind of a patient is interesting to me because I can find things or I can get them to tell me things that they want to improve on and I can hone in on those things. And I'd like to think that there can better quality of life just in that and the fact that they're supported and I can help them with things, whereas they come and see their doctor, get a prescription and they have to walk out the door in that way. I think it's a really unique opportunity to be able to work with somebody who could maybe possibly have fallen through the cracks and from no fault of anyone else's. \n\n38:32Sandy ReiterBut there's just no time to be able to pull someone like that up and go, okay, let's make you feel special and see what we can do to make your quality of life a little better. Which takes time. \n\n38:47David OlssonRight. If I'm understanding, this seems to be outside any symptoms or any condition you're. \n\n38:54Sandy ReiterTalking yeah, I mean, generally it's somebody who, say, has chronic lung condition, so there's always going to be a cough and there's always going to be something, right. And with the cough, there's always something else. There's something in their hearts or something. With their diabetes, there's always a plethora. Right. They just generally don't have a lung condition, so then there's always something that bobs to the top, so to speak, and you're kind of like okay, let's see what we can do about that. And then next month it'll be something else. And so you can try to and a lot of times what I'm finding is it's just a listening ear on the other end if you want to really simplify it. \n\n39:38Sandy ReiterSometimes they just need somebody to hear them and to go, it's horrible, that sounds horrible, or wow, that must have been very painful for you. And they just need that verification or the validation. \n\n39:58David OlssonCan I be bold saying that's the trust thing you're working with yes. \n\n40:05Sandy ReiterAnd to sort of help them feel supported and then sometimes a layer can come off and you might go, oh, I didn't know that about you. Okay, let's see. Yes, that's right. As they feel. \n\n40:17David OlssonAnd I kind of like saying that. And that was in the job description, right? \n\n40:21Sandy ReiterThat's right. Well said. \n\n40:26David OlssonBut to speak to that, you did seek this role. Can you speak to the difference between your expectations and then where you are now and how one would be anticipation, I guess, and the other is what really impacts you experience? \n\n40:46Sandy ReiterI would say the role in itself has been really good. I think it's all the side things that I didn't necessarily expect. I didn't necessarily expect to feel that feeling of isolation where I am sitting in my office and I got to figure out who I got to network to and talk to. So some of those interesting just I didn't expect to feel like that or what else? Some of the challenges of seeing a chronic disease patient and me going, man, I don't know. It's just my own personality, I think coming through in a space where you're not working in a team of five or six of us, it's just me, so learning about myself too, and how I work and how I can do better and how I've made mistakes and just learning how to communicate better boundaries, all of that. \n\n41:44Sandy ReiterI think a lot of it was just personal things versus I didn't necessarily have a ton of expectations for the job. I knew what I was wanting was the hours, the days that I could spend at Christmas, and it's a real Christmas. Versus the other thing was I knew I would be working with doctors who I knew right, because I had worked with them for so many years. So going into the job, I knew it was going to be fine, you know what I mean? It's just some of the other things I didn't expect to feel is a little bit of that isolation or sometimes when I'm trying to figure out how to deal with a patient, I kind of now have to call somebody versus leaning over and being like, okay, what about this here? It's just a different way to problem solve. \n\n42:34David OlssonAnd do you find that difference? Is it differently enabling or is it more work or less work? Or how would you describe the difference between the two? \n\n42:50Sandy ReiterYeah, it's probably a little bit more work because to try to figure out something is communication. So usually it takes an email and I have to compile something or we have to figure out who's got that person that I want to talk to. How can we figure out a team's meet? Okay, I'll meet you at 02:00 this afternoon. Because I have a chunk of time, sometimes it takes a little bit longer to get my answer versus in a setting where, say, in the nurse's station and you can just pop on over and have a two minute conversation. And sometimes that was all I needed was just to quickly run over to this person. So it's a different way to sometimes get to the end. Right. \n\n43:32David OlssonAnd if I'm correct, one was remote and one was within the same environment. Yes, it is very much that line. Is it? \n\n43:42Sandy ReiterYeah, I would say just because for me, I guess I didn't think that I would miss having those colleagues around. So it's just the feeling of, like, I am the only nurse in this clinic. I own it for the flavor that it is, so it's going to be unique to me. So everybody has their own identity. Right. So it's a little bit of a different feeling than being one of ten nurses one day and you all have the same load. It's just a different okay, so you. \n\n44:17David OlssonJust give me the analogy of one of ten nurses that have the same load. \n\n44:21Sandy ReiterThat's right. Versus I am the nurse in this. \n\n44:23David OlssonClinic versus the Sandy. \n\n44:25Sandy ReiterYes. \n\n44:26David OlssonIt's only one Sandy. \n\n44:28Sandy ReiterYes. \n\n44:28David OlssonOkay. Well, Sandy, this has been incredibly valuable and I really am thankful that you spent 05:00 on a Saturday Sunday sorry, sunday night talking about your job and so openly too. And I do want to ensure you that we will be very confident about who you are personally. But the information that you provided is we didn't talk about technology too much, but you gave me a real sense of your role in the environment and how it impacts you and how it impacted the doctors too. So thank you very much for that. We will be following up with the consent form that should have gone out beforehand and then they thank you of $250 each transfer. I just need to make sure that I have the right email address. That would be the most unfortunate thing. Sandy Reiter 18 at@gmail.com. \n\n45:30Sandy ReiterYeah. \n\n45:31David OlssonCool. Maybe I'll just throw it. Is there anything else you want to share? \n\n45:37Sandy ReiterNo, just want to say you are a very good interviewer. \n\n45:41David OlssonYou know what? At one point, I'm like, you do what I do. I think I'm trying to learn how to listen. \n\n45:47Sandy ReiterYeah, no, that was very good. So I just want to give you that feedback too. \n\n45:51David OlssonOkay. I did this for a few weeks now and that's the first time we. \n\n45:57Sandy ReiterSaid that it was easy to talk to you, so thank you for that. \n\n46:01David OlssonI'm glad. And that's what I want to be. And maybe I live here. You live here. Maybe I'll see you sometime. But thank you very much for spending the time. And do have a wonderful Sunday evening. \n\n46:15Sandy ReiterHey, I will. Thank you. \n\n46:17David OlssonCheers. Bye.",
