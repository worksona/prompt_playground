Despite prices climbing in 2021, contractors continued to face declines, but with continued increases in the price of energy following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, contractors enjoyed a massive increase in business. This trend of prices influencing business continued through 2024 when revenue dropped in 2023 but will return to growth in 2024. Overall, industry revenue has been increasing at a CAGR of 1.5% over the past five years to reach an estimated $12.5 billion in 2024, including an estimated increase of 2.0% in 2024 alone. Companies have faced environmental regulatory pushbacks that have deemed projects unprofitable, causing some contractors to cease operations. The Keystone XL pipeline project was supposed to connect the United States to Canada, but executive legislation from the US government shut down the project because of environmental concerns. Nonetheless, other new construction projects, like the Trans Mountain expansion and the Coastal Gas Link pipeline, benefitted contractors. Pipeline construction contractors will continue to enjoy growth but at a more modest pace. Contractors will not benefit from the same amount of new construction, contributing to slower growth. The push towards renewable energy will deter significant oil and gas infrastructure investments. Still, growing demand from export markets will encourage investments. Overall, industry revenue is forecast to climb at a CAGR of 0.8% to $13.1 billion through the end of 2029.\n\nPage 13:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  13  Performance  Track historical, current and forward- looking trends in revenue, profit and other performance indicators that make or break an industry.\n\nPage 14:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  14  3.

Price fluctuations have contributed to considerable volatility     Oil and gas prices greatly impact pipeline construction activity. As prices expand, there is more transportation and production, leading to an uptick in the need for oil and gas transportation pipelines, gas utility distribution pipelines, oil and gas storage tanks, pumping stations, oil refineries, gas processing facilities and other related projects.     While the pandemic caused prices to sink, they shot back up the following year and continued on that trajectory after the Russia-Ukraine crisis, which led to a massive rebound in revenue for contractors in 2022.     New drilling techniques allowed extractors to recover more petroleum, leading to more transportation. Even so, Canada has a fair number of pipelines and infrastructure, which has led to fewer construction projects. While prices falling led to declines in 2023, prices climbing in 2024 will lead to expansion.  Environmental regulations and concerns flare up     Environmental concerns over oil and gas have blocked many construction projects. The Keystone XL pipeline project was one of modern history's most infamous pipeline construction plans.     The pipeline's owner, TC Energy, had already begun construction of the major addition when it encountered numerous legal challenges, with executive legislation from the United States Government eventually striking down the project.     The push for renewable energy sources (wind and solar in particular) has made companies reluctant to invest in new pipeline infrastructure. Government funding for renewables through investment tax credits and the Smart Renewables and Electrification Pathways Program may hinder downstream private investment.  Concerns around profitability have led some contractors to cease operations     Fragmentation among oil and gas pipeline contractors is high, with many local and regional contractors. Contractors have exited and focused on more profitable ventures as business has been volatile. Large pipeline contractor AECOM sold off their oil and gas pipeline construction operations, stating they were risky and low-profit.     Contractors have found it harder to find and retain skilled engineers, which has led to rising wages. In recent years, labour shortages have hammered the Canadian construction sector because of an aging workforce and younger workers not interested in construction. Contractors have had to hike wages to attract and retain skilled workers, hindering profit.  Oil and gas pipeline construction contractors have enjoyed growth despite headwinds     Despite the push for renewable energy through government investment and an already well- established pipeline infrastructure in Canada, oil and gas pipeline construction contractors have enjoyed growth.\n\nPage 20:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  20     While well-established pipeline infrastructure exists in Canada and has led contractors to rely on repair and maintenance expenditure as a steady source of business, new construction activity has benefitted contractors.     The Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline was a boon to pipeline contractors, with the total costs comprising $30.9 billion and expanding 1,150km from Alberta to British Columbia.     Oil and gas pipeline construction contractors have also enjoyed growth from the Coastal Gas Link pipeline, costing $14.9 billion and expanding 670km in British Columbia for exports to Asia.  Changing interest rate levels have impacted contractors     While oil and gas pipeline construction contractors have benefitted from high oil and gas prices, which have incentivized oil and gas producers to invest in their operations and energy infrastructure, interest rate levels have hindered some growth.     Surging oil and gas prices in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine coincided with interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada. Rate hikes continued in 2023 and oil and gas prices plummeted, hindering aggregate private investment.     Interest rate cuts in 2024 and the strengthening of oil and gas prices may represent opportunities for contractors to enjoy strong growth, as these trends greatly incentivize downstream markets.\n\nPage 21:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  21  What influences industry volatility?  Oil and gas prices continue to fluctuate     The fluctuation of oil and gas prices plays a critical role in determining expenditures on new pipeline construction and expansion. As prices drop, contractors face reduced revenue and investment weighs heavily on future projects.     Recent volatility has intensified because of external factors. The pandemic led to a sharp drop in prices, impacting revenue streams for contractors. However, prices surged following geopolitical events such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting increased production and investment and strong growth for contractors.  Regulations affect projects and expansions     Government and environmental regulations often halt construction projects, posing significant challenges for oil and gas pipeline contractors. These regulations can arise from new policies addressing climate change and promoting sustainability, which have become increasingly central to government agendas.     The transition towards renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, diminishes expenditures for traditional oil and gas infrastructure. This shift signals a long-term trend that contractors must navigate as investments pivot towards greener alternatives, potentially jeopardizing their future projects and growth opportunities.\n\nPage 22:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  22  How do successful businesses overcome volatility?  Effectively manage risk  Navigating the oil and gas industry’s inherent volatility requires proactive risk management. By identifying potential risks early, companies can implement strategies to mitigate impacts, ensuring project stability and protecting investments throughout fluctuating market conditions.  Develop links with suppliers  Establishing robust relationships with raw material suppliers ensures consistent access to essential inputs. This collaboration can lead to favourable pricing and timely deliveries, enabling pipeline construction projects to proceed smoothly, even during unpredictable market shifts.\n\nPage 23:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  23\n\nPage 24:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  24  Outlook   ↑   2024-29 Revenue CAGR +0.8%  What's driving the industry outlook?  New projects drying up to present headwinds     Oil and gas pipeline construction contractors will not enjoy the same amount of new construction over the next five years. While contractors will benefit from continued construction on the Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline for part of the outlook period, the project is set for completion in the second half of 2024, hindering growth for oil and gas pipeline construction contractors.     As oil production slows, many experts believe there is enough pipeline available and expansion will not be necessary. Also, the recent completion of the Coastal Gas Link pipeline in late 2023 will take away a source of revenue for oil and gas pipeline contractors.  The push for clean energy to pressure infrastructure investments     The shift toward renewable energy will deter investments in oil and gas as clients become more focused on sustainability. Proposed clean energy regulations (CER) may hinder growth as restrictions on natural gas and oil power plants increase.     Restrictions placed on natural gas power plants by 2035 will hinder new power plant construction since many natural gas power plants are intended to operate for 25 to 30 years, potentially reducing domestic demand for oil and gas and the need for new pipeline infrastructure.     Still, oil and gas pipeline construction contractors will continue to enjoy growth through maintenance and repair expenditures necessary to keep existing infrastructure running.  Energy exports present an opportunity for contractors     Canadian oil is a hot commodity for other countries and as exports remain steady, so will transportation, leading to upgrades and repairs for current infrastructure. Oil sands reserves produce heavy oil that requires refinement, which results in companies upgrading their facilities.     Strong demand from export markets like Asia may incentivize downstream markets to expand existing infrastructure, particularly as government regulations and investment look to phase out nonrenewable energy.     Uncertainty surrounding Europe's energy supply could benefit contractors since Europe has historically depended on Russia for oil and natural gas and will need a new source to satisfy its energy needs. While Canada does not export much natural gas to Europe, exports to the US will increase as the country looks to satisfy Europe, potentially increasing infrastructure investments for pipelines to the US.  Profit growth to remain muted     Climbing input prices like steel and concrete may hinder profit expansion for oil and gas pipeline contractors. As growth slows and input prices climb, contractors may look to undercut one another, sacrificing profit to gain additional business.\n\nPage 25:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  25     Downstream companies will look for lower prices from contractors to maintain their profit levels and align with energy price drops, potentially hindering profit and leading to price-based declines.     As labour shortages continue to plague the Canadian construction sector, oil and gas pipeline contractors will continue to face higher wages. The need to attract and retain skilled civil and petroleum engineers will keep wage costs high.\n\nPage 26:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  26\n\nPage 27:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  27  Life Cycle   Mature  Why is the industry mature?

      "result": "The report from IBISWorld on the Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction industry in Canada offers an overview of the sector's current state and its projected trends up to 2029. The industry is experiencing growth driven by high energy prices, although this is tempered by environmental concerns and regulatory challenges. The emphasis on renewable energy is making companies hesitant to invest in new pipeline infrastructure. There has been a notable slowdown in major pipeline completions, and contractors might face difficulties in finding new projects despite potential boosts from exports.\n\nDespite these challenges, some growth is anticipated, although at a slower pace, largely fueled by maintenance and repair expenditures. The industry is heavily concentrated in Alberta, with significant activity in British Columbia and Saskatchewan due to their oil and natural gas production capacities. Key challenges for the industry include the fluctuating prices of oil, gas, and steel, regulatory compliance, and labor shortages.\n\nMajor companies in this sector include Fluor Corporation, Aecon, and Graham Construction, which face competition within a market where small companies operate regionally, and larger companies rely on subcontractors. The industry's future will be influenced by the push for clean energy, the availability of projects, and international demand for Canadian oil and gas exports. Economic growth and commodity prices play crucial roles in shaping the pipeline construction sector's landscape.",

      "result": "1. Key Metrics Review\n- **Critical Metrics**: Revenue, profit margin, employee statistics, and key external drivers such as crude oil prices and nonresidential construction values are critical metrics. For 2024, revenue is projected at $12.5 billion with a profit margin of 6.8%.\n- **Trends and Patterns**: The industry has experienced moderate revenue volatility with a CAGR of 1.5% from 2019 to 2024 and is projected to grow at 0.8% from 2024 to 2029. Employee numbers have increased modestly, but the number of businesses is decreasing.\n- **Industry Standards Comparison**: Profit margins are slightly higher than the sector average, indicating greater efficiency or premium charging capabilities. However, the industry is subject to external factors such as fluctuating oil and gas prices and regulatory policies.\n- **Anomalies or Concerns**: Declining profit margins since 2019 by 0.6 percentage points are concerning, mainly driven by higher wage costs due to labor shortages.\n\n2. Performance Analysis\n- **Success Indicators**: The successful completion of major projects like Coastal GasLink and the Trans Mountain Expansion are key success indicators, contributing significantly to revenue growth.\n- **Areas for Improvement**: Expansion and diversification into renewable energy markets could mitigate reliance on oil and gas sectors facing regulatory and social pressures.\n- **Bottlenecks and Constraints**: Regulatory hurdles and environmental concerns are significant constraints, slowing down project approvals and completions. Labor shortages further strain capacity, pushing wage costs higher.\n- **Optimization Opportunities**: Advancements in technology and adopting innovative construction materials can improve efficiency and reduce environmental impacts.

Despite prices climbing in 2021, contractors continued to face declines, but with continued increases in the price of energy following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, contractors enjoyed a massive increase in business. This trend of prices influencing business continued through 2024 when revenue dropped in 2023 but will return to growth in 2024. Overall, industry revenue has been increasing at a CAGR of 1.5% over the past five years to reach an estimated $12.5 billion in 2024, including an estimated increase of 2.0% in 2024 alone. Companies have faced environmental regulatory pushbacks that have deemed projects unprofitable, causing some contractors to cease operations. The Keystone XL pipeline project was supposed to connect the United States to Canada, but executive legislation from the US government shut down the project because of environmental concerns. Nonetheless, other new construction projects, like the Trans Mountain expansion and the Coastal Gas Link pipeline, benefitted contractors. Pipeline construction contractors will continue to enjoy growth but at a more modest pace. Contractors will not benefit from the same amount of new construction, contributing to slower growth. The push towards renewable energy will deter significant oil and gas infrastructure investments. Still, growing demand from export markets will encourage investments. Overall, industry revenue is forecast to climb at a CAGR of 0.8% to $13.1 billion through the end of 2029.\n\nPage 13:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  13  Performance  Track historical, current and forward- looking trends in revenue, profit and other performance indicators that make or break an industry.\n\nPage 14:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  14  3.

Price fluctuations have contributed to considerable volatility     Oil and gas prices greatly impact pipeline construction activity. As prices expand, there is more transportation and production, leading to an uptick in the need for oil and gas transportation pipelines, gas utility distribution pipelines, oil and gas storage tanks, pumping stations, oil refineries, gas processing facilities and other related projects.     While the pandemic caused prices to sink, they shot back up the following year and continued on that trajectory after the Russia-Ukraine crisis, which led to a massive rebound in revenue for contractors in 2022.     New drilling techniques allowed extractors to recover more petroleum, leading to more transportation. Even so, Canada has a fair number of pipelines and infrastructure, which has led to fewer construction projects. While prices falling led to declines in 2023, prices climbing in 2024 will lead to expansion.  Environmental regulations and concerns flare up     Environmental concerns over oil and gas have blocked many construction projects. The Keystone XL pipeline project was one of modern history's most infamous pipeline construction plans.     The pipeline's owner, TC Energy, had already begun construction of the major addition when it encountered numerous legal challenges, with executive legislation from the United States Government eventually striking down the project.     The push for renewable energy sources (wind and solar in particular) has made companies reluctant to invest in new pipeline infrastructure. Government funding for renewables through investment tax credits and the Smart Renewables and Electrification Pathways Program may hinder downstream private investment.  Concerns around profitability have led some contractors to cease operations     Fragmentation among oil and gas pipeline contractors is high, with many local and regional contractors. Contractors have exited and focused on more profitable ventures as business has been volatile. Large pipeline contractor AECOM sold off their oil and gas pipeline construction operations, stating they were risky and low-profit.     Contractors have found it harder to find and retain skilled engineers, which has led to rising wages. In recent years, labour shortages have hammered the Canadian construction sector because of an aging workforce and younger workers not interested in construction. Contractors have had to hike wages to attract and retain skilled workers, hindering profit.  Oil and gas pipeline construction contractors have enjoyed growth despite headwinds     Despite the push for renewable energy through government investment and an already well- established pipeline infrastructure in Canada, oil and gas pipeline construction contractors have enjoyed growth.\n\nPage 20:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  20     While well-established pipeline infrastructure exists in Canada and has led contractors to rely on repair and maintenance expenditure as a steady source of business, new construction activity has benefitted contractors.     The Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline was a boon to pipeline contractors, with the total costs comprising $30.9 billion and expanding 1,150km from Alberta to British Columbia.     Oil and gas pipeline construction contractors have also enjoyed growth from the Coastal Gas Link pipeline, costing $14.9 billion and expanding 670km in British Columbia for exports to Asia.  Changing interest rate levels have impacted contractors     While oil and gas pipeline construction contractors have benefitted from high oil and gas prices, which have incentivized oil and gas producers to invest in their operations and energy infrastructure, interest rate levels have hindered some growth.     Surging oil and gas prices in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine coincided with interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada. Rate hikes continued in 2023 and oil and gas prices plummeted, hindering aggregate private investment.     Interest rate cuts in 2024 and the strengthening of oil and gas prices may represent opportunities for contractors to enjoy strong growth, as these trends greatly incentivize downstream markets.\n\nPage 21:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  21  What influences industry volatility?  Oil and gas prices continue to fluctuate     The fluctuation of oil and gas prices plays a critical role in determining expenditures on new pipeline construction and expansion. As prices drop, contractors face reduced revenue and investment weighs heavily on future projects.     Recent volatility has intensified because of external factors. The pandemic led to a sharp drop in prices, impacting revenue streams for contractors. However, prices surged following geopolitical events such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting increased production and investment and strong growth for contractors.  Regulations affect projects and expansions     Government and environmental regulations often halt construction projects, posing significant challenges for oil and gas pipeline contractors. These regulations can arise from new policies addressing climate change and promoting sustainability, which have become increasingly central to government agendas.     The transition towards renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, diminishes expenditures for traditional oil and gas infrastructure. This shift signals a long-term trend that contractors must navigate as investments pivot towards greener alternatives, potentially jeopardizing their future projects and growth opportunities.\n\nPage 22:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  22  How do successful businesses overcome volatility?  Effectively manage risk  Navigating the oil and gas industry’s inherent volatility requires proactive risk management. By identifying potential risks early, companies can implement strategies to mitigate impacts, ensuring project stability and protecting investments throughout fluctuating market conditions.

New projects drying up to present headwinds     Oil and gas pipeline construction contractors will not enjoy the same amount of new construction over the next five years. While contractors will benefit from continued construction on the Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline for part of the outlook period, the project is set for completion in the second half of 2024, hindering growth for oil and gas pipeline construction contractors.     As oil production slows, many experts believe there is enough pipeline available and expansion will not be necessary. Also, the recent completion of the Coastal Gas Link pipeline in late 2023 will take away a source of revenue for oil and gas pipeline contractors.  The push for clean energy to pressure infrastructure investments     The shift toward renewable energy will deter investments in oil and gas as clients become more focused on sustainability. Proposed clean energy regulations (CER) may hinder growth as restrictions on natural gas and oil power plants increase.     Restrictions placed on natural gas power plants by 2035 will hinder new power plant construction since many natural gas power plants are intended to operate for 25 to 30 years, potentially reducing domestic demand for oil and gas and the need for new pipeline infrastructure.     Still, oil and gas pipeline construction contractors will continue to enjoy growth through maintenance and repair expenditures necessary to keep existing infrastructure running.  Energy exports present an opportunity for contractors     Canadian oil is a hot commodity for other countries and as exports remain steady, so will transportation, leading to upgrades and repairs for current infrastructure. Oil sands reserves produce heavy oil that requires refinement, which results in companies upgrading their facilities.     Strong demand from export markets like Asia may incentivize downstream markets to expand existing infrastructure, particularly as government regulations and investment look to phase out nonrenewable energy.     Uncertainty surrounding Europe's energy supply could benefit contractors since Europe has historically depended on Russia for oil and natural gas and will need a new source to satisfy its energy needs. While Canada does not export much natural gas to Europe, exports to the US will increase as the country looks to satisfy Europe, potentially increasing infrastructure investments for pipelines to the US.  Profit growth to remain muted     Climbing input prices like steel and concrete may hinder profit expansion for oil and gas pipeline contractors. As growth slows and input prices climb, contractors may look to undercut one another, sacrificing profit to gain additional business.\n\nPage 25:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  25     Downstream companies will look for lower prices from contractors to maintain their profit levels and align with energy price drops, potentially hindering profit and leading to price-based declines.     As labour shortages continue to plague the Canadian construction sector, oil and gas pipeline contractors will continue to face higher wages. The need to attract and retain skilled civil and petroleum engineers will keep wage costs high.\n\nPage 26:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  26\n\nPage 27:\nIBISWorld   | Oil & Gas Pipeline Construction in Canada   Aug 2024  27  Life Cycle   Mature  Why is the industry mature?
