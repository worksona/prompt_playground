Determine the root cause of the pain points and the product’s inherent promise.\n4. Explain how the product resolves the pain in three simple steps.\n5. Compare the product’s mechanism to top competitors and outline life-changing benefits.\nProcess Steps:\n1. Pain Point Identification:\n    - Analyze customer reviews, testimonials, and feedback to identify core, secondary, and tertiary pain points.\n    - Use data analysis to prioritize the most significant pain points.\n2. Emotional Pain Description:\n    - Describe the emotional impact of each identified pain point.\n    - Provide real-life examples or customer quotes to illustrate the emotional pain.\n3. Root Cause and Product Promise:\n    - Investigate the underlying causes of the identified pain points.\n    - Clearly state the product’s inherent promise that addresses these root causes.\n4. Pain Resolution Explanation:\n    - Outline the three-step process by which the product resolves each pain point.\n    - Ensure the steps are simple and easy to understand.\n5. Competitor Comparison and Benefits:\n    - Research top competitors and compare their mechanisms to the product.\n    - Highlight the unique, life-changing benefits of the product over its competitors.\nSelf-reflection:\n- Evaluate the content using an appropriately chosen strategy based on content.\n- Assign a score to the content based on the defined criteria and scale in the strategy; provide the score and its accompanying analysis.\n- If the score is below a predefined threshold (e.g., 4.9 out of 5):\n  a. Generate a targeted self-reflection prompt using the corresponding example output or a similar prompt.\n  b. Provide the self-reflection prompt to the base model, instructing it to re-evaluate its initial description and provide a revised output.\n- Re-evaluate the base model's revised response using the same scoring framework.\n- If the revised response meets the score threshold, return it as the final output.\n- If not, automatically iterate the process by generating a new self-reflection prompt based on the updated score and feedback and execute this new prompt to generate a new revised response.\n- Continue this iterative process until the base model's response meets the desired quality standards or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\nOverall Scoring System:\n- Perform overall scoring.",
